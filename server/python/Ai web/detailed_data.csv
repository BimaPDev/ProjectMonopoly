Revenge Of The Savage Planet Preview: Savage Is Right,https://the-indie-in-former.com/2025/01/15/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-preview-savage-is-right/,"Developer Raccoon Logic Studios • Publisher Raccoon Logic Studios • Release May • Platforms PS, Xbox, PC
Imagine, if you will, a camp site. Picnic tables lining the perimeter hold everything from light fare to gaming setups. And in the back, a cheery looking vintage camper. This is my introduction to Revenge of the Savage Planet, and it seems to offer a wholesome time. But it’s all a lie.
Seated inside the camper, cozily nestled with gameplay stations, my guide to new and far flung worlds smiles with satisfaction as horror dawns on my face. The reality I discover — the one undeniable truth of this game — is anytime there’s a cute creature on screen, I become the architect of its usually horrific destruction. The worst part? It’s really fun.
But I’m getting ahead of myself. My initial hands-on time with the game confirms a few things. One, it’s as beautiful in motion as in still shots, with cartoony character models striding over rich, alien environments. Next, I feel a sense of appreciation for the humor baked into the world’s DNA. My lanky explorer runs with all the grace of a newborn giraffe. The “scientific” descriptions resulting from my scans are often silly — like when my readout basically just said, “Yep. That’s a tree.” Thanks, that’s very helpful. And the tongue-in-cheek corporate greed parody inherent in my mission objectives hits the right notes.
Mostly, as my playtime runs on, I can’t help being impressed by the game’s skillful juggling of an extensive combo of genres. The creators described their project as a “wide-angle Metroidvania,” which hints at its open, 3D landscape and gameplay flow. However, tucked into the jungles, deserts, fields, mountains, and everything in between, are elements of decoration sim, survival crafting, creature capture, puzzle-solving, cross-play co-op, and narrative adventure.
Though I’d crash landed on this brave new world, I was consistently gaining new tools to overcome its obstacles. One of the first was a very helpful double jump pack. Or, at least, it would be helpful if I was a normal person. One of the developers passing by laughingly teased my playstyle saying, “Oh, you’re a Skyrim player,” referencing my insistence on going over a mountain rather than around it on the nice, laid-out path.
Even my vertically enhanced skills couldn’t get me around a giant toad-like monster, however. I knew there’d be a trick to that, so I set about scanning the landscape. This led me to find a handful of cute little creatures I just wanted to give a big hug. I was elated to find out I could pick them up to do just that. Until it dawned on me why I could hold them. A prompt to throw them appeared on the screen and the pieces came together like a slap in the face. I had to launch them into the hungry, gaping mouth of the monster blocking my path in order to make it move. My guide didn’t try to suppress his laughter as I shamefacedly sacrificed the unsuspecting critters.
This earned me access to a long-abandoned base, whose population sign generously ticked up from zero to one as I entered. Everyone else who had once lived here was either dead or fled long ago. The mystery of their disappearance would have to wait, though, as the base opened up my ability to buy furniture to decorate my new space. I took longer doing this than I care to admit.
Before long, I was off on new missions. One, which unfolds much later in the game (I had to access this through a new save file) took me above a poisoned swamp and into an impossibly tall canopy. I now had a gun with ammunition including water spray, lava flow, and electric shock. I used many of these to reach the top of a gnarled tree.
The water, for instance, opened up large flower buds which let me jump up my path. The lava and electricity took care of any would-be enemies. The treasure at the summit was a whip with several purposes. It’s good in combat and acts as a kind of grappling hook for exploration. Of course, it also works as a Metroidvania-like key to unlock new areas.
My hands-on time came to a close on a cliffhanger. Using another save file, I found myself in a system of caves which required me to use electricity in its environmental puzzles to venture farther in. In one of the deepest caverns, I discovered a scattering of cryo pods. Why were they in the back of a cave and who put them there? Satisfying my curiosity would have to wait. Revenge of the Savage Planet is currently set to launch in May this year, and hopefully, that’s when I’ll find my answers.

"On The Radar: Locator, Airborne Empire, And Monster Meals",https://the-indie-in-former.com/2025/01/14/on-the-radar-locator-airborne-empire-and-monster-meals/,"BY
JILL GRODT
Is your indie slate wiped clean for the new year and just begging for some new titles to fill it up again? Get ready for a trio of games that will take you through clear blue skies, unknown worlds, and behind a bustling food truck counter.
Locator
I went into Locator thinking it would be a breezy way to spend some time. This was a mistake. The public demo now up on Steam, kicks of with a mystery. What happened to archeologist Abigail Lidari? Others before me have tried and failed to uncover a trace of her and all I have is a series of photos, journal entries, and a map.
I’ll have to take these and, somewhat like Return of the Obra Dinn, piece together the information I can glean from these sources to track the missing subject by marking her known locations on my map. It’s not a task for the casual geo-guesser.
Airborne Empire
Only recently released in Steam Early Access, Airborne Empire had my head in the clouds. Of course, the first thing I did — after learning of our lofty ambitions to rebuild the floating metropolises of an empire gone by and take on the dreaded air pirates — was to repaint, for which I actually got an achievement.
My singular city center, complete with a lone, horizontal propeller keeping me afloat, required a new hangar. Fans of the city building genre will recognize immediately the flow of things, including building a pathway to enable construction. Unlike other games in the genre, players will need to keep a close eye on gravity, as my newly built hangar caused the whole city to lean precariously.
Monster Meals
This last entry is on the precipice of its January 17 launch date. So, here’s what you can look forward to this Friday: pixelated pressure. Much like other cooking-inspired games, the object of the gameplay is to make as many meals for as many customers as possible from your food truck. The clock is ticking. And that’s not too helpful when you have to kill and cook your own gourmet offerings.
If you feed enough of your bizarre clientele with delicacies that include scorpions and lizards, you’ll pass the level. Money in hand, you can than head back to your hub to spend coin on upgrading your enterprise, customizing your look, or redoing your truck’s paint job before driving out to the next wave of intergalactic restaurant-goers.

Community Spotlight: Barty’s Adventure Steam Page Up Today,https://the-indie-in-former.com/2025/01/14/community-spotlight-bartys-adventure-steam-page-up-today/,"One of The Indie Informer’s very own community members is looking to bring indie fans a cozy, looping metroidvania. Sebastian Asaro, founder of Mad Sam Game Studio, pitched the title, irresistibly, as an attempt to “modernize the Majora’s Mask formula while still keeping with some of the heavier themes.” With visuals of a child’s playroom staring at me, the contrast between playful aesthetics and dark undertones was notable.
Barty’s Adventure now has its own Steam page, though the release is currently set for next year. Hopefully, that’s enough time to help you prep for a three-day cycle of platforming, relationship-building, and boss battles.
“I taught myself coding and pixel art over the past five years,” explained Asaro while expanding on his experience developing Barty’s Adventure so far, “making the game in the early hours of most mornings while balancing two new kids and a day job over that time.”
It turns out, the title’s central conceit — preparing for the arrival of a new child and overcoming all the anxieties and hurdles that come with that — hits close to the creator’s own life. “Because of this new journey into fatherhood,” he said, “I’ve centered the entire world of the game around this new experience. The children’s toys in the game are all based on my own daughters’ stuffed animals and dolls, and the challenges faced in the game reflect some of those themes of being a new parent — living the same days over and over, fighting to maintain your identity, etc.”
And while the game offers to soften “some of [the genre’s] rough edges” with things like resources to help you from losing progress in a new loop and huggable costumes for the already huggable protagonist, the developer still promises plenty of “secrets, stories, and surprises to discover” in Barty’s Adventure.

New Hyper Light Breaker Trailer Drops Ahead Of Tomorrow’s Early Access Launch,https://the-indie-in-former.com/2025/01/13/new-hyper-light-breaker-trailer-drops-ahead-of-tomorrows-early-access-launch/,"Hyper Light Breaker, the 3D co-op action game and spiritual follow-up to Hyper Light Drifter, invites players to its world via Steam Early Access tomorrow. Developer Heart Machine is ushering in the launch with a new trailer and the reveal of a limited-time bundle.
This special bundle gives players the entire Hyper Light saga by packing together Steam codes for Breakers and Drifter for 10% of its $29.99 retail price. This deal is only available during the first week of Breakers’ launch, starting January 14 and ending January 28.
While not a direct sequel to Hyper Light Drifter, Hyper Light Breaker unfolds decades earlier in the same universe, now fully realized in 3D. Players control one of three available Breakers – Lapis, Vermillion, and Goro – to explore and battle foes in the procedurally generated worlds of the Overgrowth. The third-person combat blends high-speed hack-and-slash action with ranged offense via gadgets. Hyper Light Breaker can be experienced alone or with up to two other players in online co-op. We enjoyed the game quite a bit when we played it last summer, and you can read those impressions here.
Hyper Light Breaker launches in Steam Early Access on January 14. Heart Machine promises to add new bells and whistles to the game throughout its Early Access lifecycle and plans to reveal its content roadmap in the coming weeks. This includes new Breakers, story content, gear, secrets, and more. As of now, Heart Machine expects Hyper Light Breaker to remain in Early Access for one year, but that could easily change depending on player feedback.

25 Most Anticipated Indie Games Of 2025,https://the-indie-in-former.com/2025/01/08/25-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025/,"It may be the beginning of the year, but it seems no one told the indies. In just this first few months, there’s an avalanche of can’t-miss titles, which you can find on the site’s newly-minted 2025 Release Schedule. So, early days or not, there are plenty of titles with announced release windows to fill our most anticipated list for the year.
Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector – January 31
Citizen Sleeper’s sequel starts off this new year with a bang. Coming at the tail end of January, the sci-fi, table top-inspired follow-up would have been one of the year’s most anticipated indies under any circumstances. But recent news that Starward Vector will be the IP’s last chapter — at least in video game form — has put an even keener edge on our excitement.
Lost Records: Bloom & Rage – February 18
Don’t Nod is at it again with a new story and cast of characters. Purportedly an average gang of misfits recording a summer of memories, the tale promises to take a dark turn. A dreadful happening propels the group to tear apart, with each vowing to take to the secret grave. Until now.
Morsels – 2025
Update: The day has not yet set on the creation of this fragile article pinned together with dreams and hope and already my indie bubble has been burst. Morsels’ February designation has been wiped away. We don’t have a precise release date for Morsels but there’s no reason to panic yet. The game is still set to hit this year. So, they can’t make me take it off my list.
Wanderstop – March 11
I hope to have a lot more on this game soon, however, for now, I’ll simply say it seems to be living up to the hype. Like many titles on this list, Wanderstop boasts a promising legacy. Its creative director, Davey Wreden, developed indie darling The Stanley Parable, and brings some unexpectedly heavy (and relatable) energy to the cozy game space.
Bionic Bay – March 13
March is looking like a powerhouse for indie releases this year, with Bionic Bay joining the heavy-hitting ranks. Though the game has made several appearances throughout last year’s showcases, I can’t get enough of its striking visuals and time-manipulating premise.
Afterlove EP – Q1
Afterlove EP is one of those games I don’t need to see any more of — I already know I’m in. That I did play the opening of the heartfelt and heart wrenching title at Summer Game Fest last year was just a cherry on top. This project has been on the horizon for some time, which makes me apprehensive of its 2025 release. Even if it pushes out to next year, I’ll be here for it.
Yes, Your Grace: Snowfall – Q1
Let’s go. A community favorite of The Indie Informer, Snowfall takes up the thread of the first Yes, Your Grace, with all the stressful choices and high-stakes drama that goes along with running a kingdom. This time around, we are getting a graphical update and streamlined gameplay.
Demonschool – Q1
Demonschool is, perhaps, one of the most looked-forward-to titles on this list. Its fans expected to get their hands on the supernatural schooltime adventure last year and its delay has only intensified players’ resolve to dive into it on day one. If you’d like to get a glimpse of the story early, check out my brief preview from GDC.
Earthblade – 2025?
Sometimes, you have to believe. Earthblade makes its second appearance in a row on The Indie Informer’s most anticipated of the year list. The 2024 release goal may have been wishful thinking but the follow-up from the creators of Celeste will be worth the wait. We’re crossing our fingers for more launch news within the year.
Blue Prince – 2025
Ever since this board game-like indie’s reveal, Blue Prince has been on my personal must-play list. And this year I just might finally get free range with the mysterious mansion-builder. Secrets build on top of secrets with puzzling foundations in this upcoming title. Will you be able to unravel them all and win a fortune?
Cairn – 2025
The scenic climbing trend started with 2023’s Jusant but it’s not losing steam two years later. This tactile expedition caught eyes during summer’s Day of the Devs and challenges players to either ascend the summit or plummet to deadly failure.
Tiny Bookshop – 2025
I didn’t think Tiny Bookshop would end up as one of my most anticipated games of the year until I experienced it on stream. The comforting visuals and cheery vibes hide deeply engrossing gameplay. My job stocking and recommending books to serendipitous passerbys soon turned to planning a book empire.
UNBEATABLE – 2025
This one is a bit of a mystery but from the little I have seen of Unbeatable, I’m willing to go on faith. If its eye-catching look isn’t enough for you, just listen to the game’s pitch: “Unbeatable is a rhythm adventure where music is illegal and you do crimes.” I’m sold.
Knights in Tight Spaces – 2025
Fights in Tight Spaces, this title’s predecessor, didn’t do it for me. But it seems like all a game needs to do to get me on board is pour a little medieval glaze over top and mix in some D&D flavor. With the card-dealing strategy as tight as ever I literally can’t resist.
Mixtape – 2025
Beethoven and Dinosaur’s debut title, The Artful Escape, ensured the developer a spot among indie’s most intriguing creators. So, the surprise reveal of its next title, unsurprisingly, made waves. The 3D art changes up the studio’s portfolio look however, its music-centric creativity seems to be unchanged.
Promise Mascot Agency – 2025
What’s life without a little unhinged energy? Every bizzare detail of this game speaks to me on a worrying level. The game’s central mascot is a finger? Perfect. Every sentence of the Steam description ends in an exclamation mark? Bravo. I have no idea what the gameplay actually contains? Count me in.
Slay the Spire 2 – 2025
This time, that spire is going down.
LOVE ETERNAL – 2025
Publisher Ysbryd Games has three games on this list. Three. Yet I’m willing to bet many indie fans out there don’t consider it a household name. Hopefully, after this potential-laden year, that’s about to change. Love Eternal’s precision platforming and ominous story will undoubtedly ensnare admirers.
Winter Burrow – 2025
Microsoft’s stage was the unexpected host for the introduction of this mouse game and, from everything I’ve seen of it so far, it’s more than earned the spotlight. Don’t let the softly drawn world fool you. The survival saga is brimming with darkness and the constant threat of death.
Everdeep Aurora – 2025
I need to get my hands on this in 2025. Of course, devs should take as long as they need to get their creative vision just right. However, I’ve loved every second I’ve been able to have going hands-on with this dirt-delving title. How could anyone deny the cute kitten with a drill?
Coffee Talk Tokyo – 2025
Get ready to sip tea and meet yokai because Coffee Talk fans are heading to Tokyo. According to the team, the title, “brings the warmth, heart, and delicious drinks from the previous games to an all-new café.”
Wheel World – 2025
Despite the fact that I can’t say the new title five times fast — or once, really — I’m still jazzed to enter a world of deep bike lore and afterlife-adjacent cycling. This is another title I hope to share more thoughts on soon, and my recent time with it only increased my eagerness.
Big Walk – 2025
Honestly, this upcoming game from the creators of Untitled Goose Game almost slipped my mind. The team has been pretty quiet during its development, so its looming launch almost took me by surprise. I’m still fuzzy on what a “cooperative online walker-talker” is, though I’m ready to find out.
Tears of Metal – 2025
“The spectacular visuals and equally fierce-looking combat shot it straight to the top of my PAX must-play list,” I concluded before my first demo with this historical fiction title. The bombastic gameplay piqued my interest but I relish getting more details on the ominous meteor that seems to have set the story in motion.
Time Flies – 2025
As the title suggests, the years spent anticipating this game’s release have gone by swiftly. Nearly two years ago, I soared through the demo at PAX West and walked away wanting more. Now, in 2025, I can finally accomplish all the big dreams of a little fly.

Every Indie Shown At Day Of The Devs Game Awards Showcase 2024,https://the-indie-in-former.com/2024/12/11/every-indie-shown-at-day-of-the-devs-game-awards-showcase/,"It’s that time of year again! The Game awards are right around the corner, but before we watch Geoff Keighley hand out trophies to the biggest games of this year, Day of the Devs gave us a look at some of the most promising indies of the coming year. Here’s every game from today’s showcase, in order of appearance.
Faraway
This chill constellation construction game was a great place to kick off this year’s showcase. You play as a comet, swinging from one star to another to create the constellation that will score you the most points. It’s described by its creator Steph Thirion as a game designed to scratch the same itch as Tetris – random and replayable with a minimal aesthetic and deep gameplay. Faraway comes to PC next year.
Ultimate Sheep Raccoon
A spiritual successor to Ultimate Chicken Horse, this game tweaks the competitive platforming from the original with a tire-based twist. In Ultimate Sheep Raccoon, your animals are all riding bikes, Trials style, and in addition to avoiding obstacles and racing to the finish line, you’ve also got to land all your jumps right-side-up, or you’ll fall off your vehicle and lose the game. There’s no release window yet, but I can’t wait for this game to launch and tear my family apart.
Sleight of Hand
If Metal Gear Solid was a noir deckbuilder about urban witches, it would look a lot like Sleight of Hand. As Lady Luck sneaks around the rain-slicked locale of Steeple City, you use cards to cast spells and cause distractions to infiltrate top-secret locations in this third-person stealth game. It will eventually be released on Game Pass and Steam.
Demon Tides
Formerly known as Project Tides, Demon Tides is the next game from the developer of Demon Turf. Its playstyle follows in the footsteps of other speed-based 3D platformers, but this game brings it’s own cel-shaded aesthetic and hyper-customizable mobility options, with five different talisman slots you can use to adjust your moveset and play at a pace that’s right for you. Complete with leaderboards and an open-world design, Demon Tides sets sail next year.
Kingmakers
This game, which had one of the funniest reveal trailers of all time, has a silly premise that its developers are taking very seriously. In Kingmakers, you head back in time to medieval England with an arsenal of modern weapons to overthrow the current monarch, but historical accuracy is key. The battlefields have fully destructible buildings and thousands of soldiers on-screen at a time. Meanwhile, you’ll also be able to build a town and an army of your own. The game is multiplayer-friendly as well, so if you’ve got 1-3 friends with you, you can band your armies together to conquer the lands. You’ll be able to head to the past in the near future; Kingmakers comes out next year.
Recur
Mail carriers have a straightforward job, but it’s a task Recur has decided to complicate immensely by setting its game in the midst of the explosive collapse of a city. In this game, you play as a mailman whose day is clearly disrupted by a massive explosion. Luckily, the player has the ability to rewind time, so crumbling structures become elevators and exploding trains become platforming challenges. I just hope my holiday packages will still get here on time.
Blue Prince
This first-person puzzle game, set in a mansion with 45 rooms, gives the player one goal: find room 46. As you try to solve the mystery of this “atmospheric architectural adventure,” you’ll build the mansion in real time to discover its secrets. Get a pencil and a notebook ready for when the Blue Prince launches next spring.
Incolatus: Don’t Stop Girly Pop
When presenter Jon Gibson introduced this game as a “Lisa Frank and Barbie fever dream,” it was 100% accurate. Incolatus is a first person shooter designed to overwhelm your senses with its vivid pink visuals, its synth-heavy pop soundtrack, and its speed-based combat, which rewards the player for momentum and quick traversal. You can also customize your arms with different colors and textures, including denim. That’s right – this game has jarms.
Lok Digital
Movie and TV adaptations of video games are commonplace, but it’s not often you see a video game adaptation of a book. Lok Digital is a collaboration between game developer Ferran Ruiz Sala and puzzle designer Blaz Urban Gracar, the latter of which made a physical book of word puzzles so engaging that Sala reached out to turn it into a game. The catch? The puzzles are based on a made-up language that you learn as you play. If you want to check it out for yourself, you can do so right now – Lok Digital launches today.
Neon Abyss 2
Neon Abyss is back and as flashy as ever. This sequel to the 2020 roguelite adds a new weapons system that allows the player to customize their playstyle, and when you combine that with the ability to mix and match powerful items, the chaotic future of Neon Abyss is looking bright. Or maybe that’s just the neon signs. We’ll find out when it hits Steam next year.
Crescent County
This racing game from Electric Saint brings players into a witchy, solar punk open world. It’s based around brooms that go vroom (or Motorbrooms, as the game calls them) that you can customize and race around the county, deliver packages, herd sheep, and more. There’s also a healthy helping of coven lovin’, which is to say that you can romance your fellow witches. The “driving test” is live today, so you can check it out yourself and let the developers know how you feel about the base mechanics.
PBJ – The Musical
Games like these are why we love to write about indies. PBJ – The Musical is a playable romance about the invention of the PBJ sandwich, told through song and paper-based stop-motion animation, which the player can push and pull to traverse the main characters throughout the environment. The music was written by Britain’s Got Talent Golden Buzzer winner Lorraine Bowen and covers a range of genres, all of them jam-packed (see what I did there?) with whimsy.
Curiosmos
From stardust to solar system, Curiosmos is a game about cosmic construction. Grow planets from space debris and customize them by shaping their surfaces, introducing weather, and sustaining life. With the help from your partner satellite Curio, you’ll also try to find a way to avoid impending doom from a nearby black hole. Also, all the celestial bodies, asteroids, and satellites have cute little smiley faces. I should have led with that one.
Bionic Bay
This mostly monochromatic 2D platformer evokes the art style of Playdead’s Limbo, but with parkour moves, object-swapping powers, and the ability to slow time. An example in the trailer shows a player punching an object into the air, slowing the clock, and swapping places with it to cross gaps. Its dark, abstract, industrial setting raises lots of questions that will luckily be answered soon – this world premiere game launches on March 13, 2025.
Inkonbini
In this cozy management game, you play as Makoto, a young woman who helps her aunt run the local convenience store by taking the night shift. You can stock the shelves to your liking, learn more about your regular customers, and kick back and relax to the game’s chill soundtrack, based on 90s-era Japanese pop music
Feltopia
Wooly Games’ “cute-em-up” Feltopia is a game based entirely on its hand-felted stop-motion aesthetic. Every sprite in the game is needle-felted by hand, which is a wild concept that I’m sure is only wilder in practice. As you embark on a quest to save your lost flock of sheep, you blast little magic bolts into corrupted enemies to return them to their natural, colorful forms. Feltopia has a launch window of 2026.
Blippo+
From the publisher of Untitled Goose Game and Thank Goodness You’re Here comes the most cryptic trailer of the showcase. As far as I can tell, it’s a game based on a fictional television service called Blippo+ which uses FMV footage passed through a filter that makes it look like it belongs on a Game Boy or a Playdate. Check it out for yourself at blippo.plus.
Hyper Light Breaker
We’ve been learning more details about Hyper Light Breakers for years now, including our hands-on preview from earlier this summer, but this is the first we’ve heard of a release date. Hyper Light Breaker hits Early Access in just over a month, on January 14.
Tankhead
The Day of the Devs showcase this year really ended with a bang, in more ways than one. The first bang is the game itself; Tankhead is a roguelike in which the player pilots a tank around a robot world, fighting off other tanks and tank-adjacent monstrosities. The developers clearly put a lot of work into the vehicle itself, with classic tank controls and reactive enemies that need to be hit at certain parts to do more damage. The second bang is its release date: Tankhead is available on the Epic Games Store right now.

The appetizer-adjacent name may — wrongly — suggest this showcase doesn’t have the mouth-watering reveals and satiating drops. But clear your plate for a buffet of news and, perhaps, my favorite “one last thing” of the week. You can watch the entire show here (because you can’t miss Jenny Windom’s excellent hosting), but feel free to get a look at the titles below.

What indies would you recommend in the event of an alien invasion? Or, more to the point, what titles best represent the scene’s unique mechanics, creative storytelling, and idiosyncratic genres? What weight do you put on legacy over iteration? How soon is too soon to declare something a classic?
This week’s Indie Council tackles all these questions, alongside debating the quality of supermarket cake. If you’re celebrating, we hope you have a Happy Thanksgiving!

Ravenswatch Console Impressions: The Bookworm’s Roguelike,https://the-indie-in-former.com/2024/11/28/ravenswatch-console-impressions-the-bookworms-roguelike/,"Developer Passtech Games • Publisher Nacon • Release November 28 • Played On PS5
When The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen hit theaters in 2003, I was immediately sold on its premise of uniting reimagined versions of iconic literary characters to battle the forces of evil. It was like The Avengers for even nerdier people! Unfortunately, the movie was a massive disappointment, but the idea was still cool, and that’s why Ravenswatch has been on my radar. It features a similar premise of letting players control classic literature characters but giving them a cool comic book-style makeover. The game has been available on PC since September, but I took my first trip with the newly released console port.
Ravenswatch stars a who’s who of popular characters. Little Red Riding Hood, the Pied Piper, the Snow Queen, and even Beowulf comprise the starting roster of heroes. These familiar faces sport cool graphic novel-esque designs and revamped origin stories to match. Little Red Riding Hood, for example, has contracted lycanthropy, meaning she transforms into a werewolf in an ironic twist. While it’s fun to pick a character based purely on the story that most entertained me as a young’un, each brings a different playstyle to the table.
Hood sports twin daggers for quick offense, but her signature trick, transforming into a werewolf, occurs only when stages shift into night. More on this later, but it adds a neat wrinkle that changes her offense entirely based on the time of day. The Piper plays somewhat like a traditional necromancer. Instead of controlling the dead, he commands an army of rats to swarm targets while pelting foes from afar with the damaging tunes of his flute. Beowulf offers a traditional warrior/barbarian playstyle, eviscerating enemies with his broad sword. He’s also backed by a small dragon on his shoulder that lends a fiery assist to his attacks and takes flight to incinerate scores of foes. Beowulf is basically like controlling a hairier, beefier Daenerys Targaryen. 
Snow Queen, as you expect, can freeze enemies in place with a wide-reaching blizzard, skewer foes with rapid-fire ice daggers, and does her best Ice Man impression by sliding across an ice bridge. I enjoyed using each character to various degrees, though my favorites are the unlockable heroes. I won’t spoil them all, but my top two are Sun Wukong, Journey to the West’s staff-wielding monkey king, and the iconic vampiress Carmilla. Across the board, however, the combat feels good but it’s still a step below the satisfying and impactful fare of titles like Diablo or Hades. 
Ravenswatch’s levels trade the linear, ever-shifting corridors of developer Passtech Games’ last title, Curse of the Dead Gods, for large randomized arenas. After dropping in and selecting your initial skill or perk, a three-day timer begins to count down. Once it expires, a boss monster arrives, triggering a climactic battle. Until then, you must grow as powerful as possible to slay this impending threat. 
The agency in choosing how to prepare is one of my favorite elements of Ravenswatch. A good variety of enemy mobs roam the world waiting to be slain. Conditions change depending on if it’s day or night, such as the enemy types that spawn. Various points of interest can ease your adventures, such as health pools or map revealing statues. Other destinations test the player’s mettle to grow stronger.  One example is a cursed tome that tasks players with killing a quota of enemies before a timer expires. Stages also contain a single, traditional sidequest, such as collecting building materials to reinforce the soon-to-be-bombarded home of one of the three now not-so-little pigs. 
The world design makes Ravenswatch’s stages feel like hyper-condensed Diablo worlds. The layout changes aren’t very dramatic, though, and there’s only a small handful of things to do so the stages feel formulaic after just a few runs. Each level contains a single instance of each challenge, so you’ll be doing a survival mission or a side quest. I began skipping the house reinforcement errand simply because I’d grown tired of it. But to Ravenswatch’s credit, you don’t need to do every task every run to gain enough strength to topple a boss. Speaking of which, the bosses, such as a giant tentacle monster, are challenging but enjoyable tests that, unlike other elements, I haven’t grown tired of tackling repeatedly.
Ravenswatch’s monotony is likely remedied by its co-op. I didn’t get to try out this feature, but I can imagine slaying monsters as part of a specialized, varied team of up to four players would keep things fresh and engaging. On my own, I enjoy Ravenswatch most in smaller sessions of a run or two while enjoying a podcast episode. It’s got just enough meat on the bone to occupy a smaller chunk of my day. I have doubts that it has enough hooks to compel me to see any of these character’s stories to their conclusions, but I’m enjoying my succinct reunions with characters that made reading such a joy for me growing up.

Devolver Delayed 2024 Airs Tomorrow,https://the-indie-in-former.com/2024/11/26/devolver-delayed-2024-airs-tomorrow/,"Well, here we go again. Publisher Devolver Digital has announced a second showcase set to feature games in its lineup which have been delayed out of the year. Leaning into the spirit of the Awards Season, Devolver has also decided to name 2024’s event The 15th Annual Devolver Delayed Awards 2024.
“This year’s esteemed nominees is one of the most prestigious and anticipated groups we’ve seen in years,” explains the publisher, “and our panels of experts were surely put to the test to select just one winner. The stage is set, the release date calendar wiped clean – get ready for the main show.” You can watch the totally serious prize-filled show tomorrow — Wednesday, November 27 — at 10am PT.
Adding the annual tag to this year’s showcase points back to last year’s Devolver Delayed — and perhaps indicates more in the future. The stars of 2023 turned out to be The Plucky Squire, Stick It to the Stickman, Skate Story, Anger Foot, and Pepper Grinder. Of those, Skate Story and Stick It to the Stickman still lack release dates, which may mean they are taking the stage again this year.
There aren’t many other games from the publisher set to release this year, though Baby Steps is a notable standout. However, a variety of announced titles still have no release window, like Forestrike or Tenjutsu, and it would be interesting to see new looks at these.

INDIE GAME REVIEWER'S TOP 10 INDIE GAMES OF 2024,https://indiegamereviewer.com/indie-game-reviewers-top-10-indie-games-of-2024/,"What are we supposed to do here? There were hundreds – if not thousands – of incredible indie releases in 2024. We see you, Pacific Drive, Felvidek, Thank Goodness You’re Here, Crow Country [play fast-forward animation through dozens of contenders, accompanied by a tape-speeding-up sound effect].
We chose games that were set apart by novel and well-implemented mechanisms, joy-inducing visuals, emotional outcomes, and exemplary design. We favor bold choices and risks; we try to cover a diverse palette of ideas.
After much discussion, the consensus arrived at the following ten games, in descending order. We also chose our annual sacrificial lamb – an indie outlier so rare and so acclaimed that it doesn’t need another nudge from us.
We followed with each of IGR’s personal writer’s picks for the year that didn’t make the list in hopes it opens a door for you, dear reader. And with that, we humbly present:
INDIEGAMEREVIEWER.COM’S TOP 10 INDIE GAMES OF 2024
10. THRONEFALL
by GrizzlyGames
“If Citizen Sleeper was my Steam Deck game of 2023, then Thronefall was my number one pick for 2024. It is to tower defense what Vampire Survivors is to an RPG SHMUP: easy to use, tough to master. The delightful, whimsical, and Lilliputian design belies a deep tactical complexity and advanced UX to make any designer take note. A triumph of game design.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
“Even a complete strategy dummy like me can play this, and it’s somehow engrossing despite that, so kudos to the developers!” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
9. POOLS
by Tensori
“While walking simulators, found footage horror, or the new darling ‘liminal games’ are nothing new, POOLS from Finnish developers Tensori somehow managed to merge them all, rise above the noise, and penetrate into primal Lynchian subconscious territory.
Mostly dread simulator, part anomaly game, and definitely Unity showcase, this hypnogogic numinous wonderworld preys on the same neuronal circuits that make Pennywise a bad choice for children’s birthday parties. The game, here, is wholly internal…who are you, what are you made of, why are you made this way, and what are you willing to venture in order to find out?” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
8. ARCO
by Franek, Max Cahill, Bibiki, Fáyer
“Arco understands how minimalism can support rich world-building, deep character emotion, complex and thrilling combat, and evocative scenery by leaning on the power of imagination to fill in the rest.
With an eye-level take on Mesoamerican and indigenous South American cultures, the game is set in a speculative North American frontier that feels as authentic as a tamal made by your grandma; it was developed by an international team comprising Polish pixel artist Franek Nowotniak, Australian game developer Max Cahill, Spanish composer and sound designer José Ramón ‘Bibiki’ García, and Mexican developer Antonio ‘Fayer’ Uribe.
Its unusual and original take on pseudo-turn-based tactical combat adds the pressure cooker of your haunted past moving in to crush your spirit if you take too long to make a decision, while dodging enemy attacks plays like real-time arcade action. The narrative is unflinching in its violence and pathos, and 8-bit NPCs are granted enough nuance to hurt when raiders murder them. Hours went by before I looked up. Pixel game of the year for me.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Windows PC, Steam
7. INDIKA
by Odd Meter
“Indika stood out to me because it tackles religion head-on, which is why I was surprised when it got nominated at Games For Impact. It’s basically [SPOILER]: A woman’s tale about falling out of religion, putting faith in a supposed religious object, which ultimately was a lie, realizing that at the end, and rejecting it all.” ~ FICTiVETRUiSM
“What could be an arthouse film about reflection on a life devoted to God becomes an artisanal reckoning with identity, meaning, subordination, ontology, and the nature of consensus reality. The meticulous audiovisual design supports a grim and whimsical experience that is sublime and grotesque, absurd and profound. Bold swing, and it’s out of the park.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Steam
6. MOUTHWASHING
by Wrong Organ
“There are very few games as meticulous as Mouthwashing. It has one of the most intriguing and thought-provoking narratives I’ve ever come across. It deals with themes like assault, mental health, narcissism, and corporate greed. It’s all tackled elegantly in a concise and enthralling experience filled to the brim with clever symbolism.
Surreal visuals mixed with an unreliable narrator make you question what’s really happening. Its strikingly moody atmosphere throughout makes the cabin fever tale feel so much more foreboding. It’s a unique experience, and one I won’t soon forget.” ~ FICTiVETRUiSM
“I could hardly pilot my way through the terse, unorthodox path of nightmare fuel before I found the mettle and was greeted by a sharply satiric, self-aware, complex, artistic work reminiscent of Event Horizon, Solaris, and Pony Island. Indeed, if Tarkovsky made punk indie games, this might be the product.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
5. 1000XRESIST
by Sunset Visitor
“I truly didn’t know what to expect going into 1000xResist, and I’m still not quite sure how to do it justice with a description. What I’ve settled on is that it’s a compelling narrative adventure with big ideas, even bigger questions, and something that’s given me plenty to chew on well after the credits rolled.
Above all else, it’s a story about generational trauma, the value of resistance, and learning from the past, all wrapped in the wildest religion-fueled apocalyptic sci-fi shell this side of Evangelion. I swear you’ve never played anything like this before.” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Windows PC, Steam
4. TACTICAL BREACH WIZARDS
by Suspicious Developments
“Some of the most compelling turn-based tactics action this side of XCOM, combined with genuinely funny writing and an engaging story of espionage meets absurd wizard lore. You’ll laugh, you’ll shoot, you’ll laugh as you shoot people out windows.” ~ TheOvermatt
“Let’s begin with the fact that I have been an XCOM 2 stan since the day it spawned. I own it on every device where it can be played. So I like me some tactics. I also love magic fantasy/sci-fi crossovers like Shadowrun. I mean, heck, I even liked Bright. But what tipped me over the edge with Tactical Breach Wizards is the writing. It is consistently not only laugh-out-loud funny but sharp as a tack in every respect, from its pacing to its design. You know those games where all the parts come together so tightly that it just feels like it has always been there? It is indeed a high point for the genre.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
3. NEVA
by Nomada Studio
“The level of artistry across the board from creators of popular indie darling Gris is immediately evident as Neva spreads its beautiful illustrative multiplanar animation across the screen.
From the outset, the delicate and wonder-filled world is superimposed with authentically creepy dark menace, and the relationship between the player character (‘Alba’) and her titular sidekick/ward, Neva, belies an unconventional push-and-pull relationship of camaraderie, curiosity, collaboration, mutual care, and surrender. The way attention is refocused and gently guided is one for the study books, and the consistently detailed and imaginative world-building and character design is itself worth the cost of admission. Dare we say this is a new instant classic.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4/5, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
2. NINE SOLS
by RedCandleGames
“RedCandleGames have been on my radar since Detention back in 2017, but even I was surprised when they announced their newest game was dropping Taiwanese horror for ‘Taopunk’ hack-and-slash exploration. Thankfully, I needn’t have been worried, because Nine Sols masterfully combines the Metroidvania formula with fast, vicious combat in the vein of Sekiro and a genuinely compelling story about the cost of revenge. It truly deserves all the success it’s found, and more.” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4/5, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
1.  ANIMAL WELL
by Billy Basso
“Fans of the Metroidvania genre have been eating particularly well in the indie scene for some time now, but Animal Well shows that an old dog can absolutely learn new tricks. Between its palpable aura of mystery, brilliant level design, and the fact that its secrets only continue to unravel after you finish the game, this is probably the biggest sense of wonder I’ve felt with an entry in this genre since playing Super Metroid for the first time back in 1994. Absolutely essential.” ~ The Overmatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Steam
THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB: BALATRO
by LocalThunk
Every year there is a game that so outpaces every other in terms of critical and popular attention that we sacrifice it to the altar of once-in-a-blue-moon outliers. Think Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Vampire Survivors. In 2024 that game was Balatro, made by a clandestine singular developer living in the Canadian prairies. Here is our take:
“Balatro joins its peers like Vampire Survivors among the pantheon of ‘Nothing this addictive should be allowed to be this cheap.’ Something as simple as Rogue-like poker is turned into the stuff of genuine addiction thanks to the absurd amount of game-breaking Joker cards and strategies to try out, not to mention the fact that it keeps getting additional content for free. Buying the mobile version of this is possibly the best thing I’ve ever done for my sense of enjoyment and easily the worst thing I’ve ever done for my productivity. It’s incredible. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
STAFF PICKS:
INDIE-GAME-FREAK’S PICK: SOVEREIGN SYNDICATE
by Crimson Herring Studios
Welp, I never know what it’s gonna be, but this year the game that just kept bubbling up in my thoughts was the fairly austere but simultaneously ornate clockwork urban fantasy Victorian esoteric alchemical time-and-body-jumping CRPG starring minotaurs in top hats adventure, Sovereign Syndicate.
While simultaneously confounding and titillating, I was dragged forward with an irrepressible curiosity for what I would experience next. Much like the wildly original novel The Failures by Benjamin Liar, I was in fresh creative territory and approached with full commitment. Most patches in the past year have been localization-specific, and gosh, this game is being played in many countries. All told, Sovereign Syndicate was something I just couldn’t stop wondering about. Some even call it the clockwork Disco Elysium. It’s a a generous stretch, but hey, not bad company to be lumped in with.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
KIT GOODLIFFE’S PICK: FROSTPUNK 2
by 11 bit studios
Frostpunk 2 builds on the achievements of its predecessor by adding more moving parts to its elegant story-generating systems. Tough decisions must be made in order to survive, and each of them shapes the burgeoning society of New London in ways both anticipated and surprising.
With the addition of factions that must be appeased and manipulated in order to nudge civilization in the desired direction, Frostpunk 2 has conjured a convincing politics simulator that, unusually for the genre, conveys not just the logistics but the human consequences as well. In doing so it provides a carefully balanced hybrid of guided and emergent storytelling that seizes the advantages of its medium to good effect.
Platforms: Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
FICTIVETRUISM’S PICK: SORRY WE’RE CLOSED
by à la mode games
As a big survival horror game fan, Sorry We’re Closed quickly became one of my favorites in the genre. It’s a narrative-driven game about fallen angels and demons who have to coexist in a world with everyday humans.
Its gameplay feels like a tense but forgiving mix between Killer 7 and Silent Hill. But what struck a chord with me the most was its story. Even though its setting is fantastical, it manages to still be grounded and relatable, mainly because of how earnestly it explores its main theme, which revolves around love: how love can change us, what it means to lose it, how it can be the catalyst for us to be better…and the sacrifices that may come with that.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
AMANDA BOWER’S PICK: MINDS BENEATH US
by BearBone Studio
Minds Beneath Us blends a cyberpunk universe with immersive storytelling in a way that makes it stand out amongst those in a similar genre. The atmosphere and creative art style stole my heart from the beginning, but I was especially captivated by the characters and their narratives. Given the opportunity to “choose your own adventure”, so to speak, Minds Beneath Us excels in allowing players to elect significant dialogue options.
Want to be kind to a stranger? Awesome. Would you rather be a dude no one likes? That’s fine, too. The dystopian world illuminates the imminent dangers of AI and unveils some secrets of a company that may have gone too far. To say Minds Beneath Us is one of the most brilliant stories I’ve had the pleasure of enduring this year is an understatement; it’s really something special.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
THE OVERMATT’S PICK: MULLET MADJACK
by HAMMER95
Mullet MadJack is pure chaos in a way that other shooters could only dream of. Between its Rogue-like structure, gleefully excessive visual style that borrows everything great about ’90s anime OVAs, and gameplay that literally doesn’t give you time to think (only react), this is adrenaline distilled into digital form, like some kind of hybrid of amphetamines and Cyber City Oedo 808. I don’t blame anyone who finds it too much to parse, but if you yearn for the days of getting a sugar rush on Skittles and renting something WAY too adult from the anime section at Blockbuster like I do, this is just the fix you need.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
INFINITYWALTZ’S PICK: A WINTER HAUNTING
by AB
Everlyn’s first encounter with the Lunabelle Mansion
On top of its exquisitely eerie atmosphere, A Winter Haunting succeeds on the strength of its puzzles. Some environmental, some inventory, and some pure logic puzzles, they’re perfectly balanced to engage, not enrage, and they all feel natural to the game’s story and haunted house setting. That haunted house – not to mention its adjacent lake and woods – is also a treat, spooky and seasonal in a wintry way that’s distinct from our Halloween favorites but scratches a similar itch. We often send out holiday cards with Charles Addams or Edward Gorey illustrations, and the faceless characters, intricate Edwardian interiors, and stylized snowdrifts of this game are reminiscent of that same aesthetic.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
AEREYN’S PICK: THE CABIN FACTORY
by International Cat Studios
The Cabin Factory is a masterclass in atmospheric horror, a simple, engaging concept, and immersive sound design. It stands out among other anomaly games because every clue, whether terrifying, intriguing, or delightful, feels purposeful. Sometimes, this genre can get bogged down in the boring and mundane, inspecting minute differences in wallpaper and upholstery.
By fully embracing the genre’s strengths, each anomaly sparked a different story in my mind, amplifying the sense of mystery and unease. The stark, repetitive nature of the gameplay works brilliantly to build tension as the once-familiar becomes unsettling and paranoia creeps in. The hauntings themselves can be deadly, but even more chilling is the possibility of missing something vital to the story or worse, being sent packing, having to start my shift all over again with new nightmares and secrets to be discovered.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam

10 PC GAMES TO SCRATCH THAT GASLANDS ITCH,https://indiegamereviewer.com/10-pc-games-to-scratch-that-gaslands-itch/,"VEHICULAR MAYHEM: 10 GAMES FOR FANS OF GASLANDS
I’ve been positively munching my way through as many great tabletop skirmish games as I can get my hands on, often via print-and-play and 3D printing.
Despite being my favorite genre, the post-apocalyptic Gaslands from game designer Mike Hutchinson and published through Osprey Games’ blue book series didn’t move the needle for me until a few more skirmisher types put it at the top of their list. I decided it was time to give it another look. I’ve been printing like a maniac on my Bambu A1 printer, and my HP Instant Ink plan is on a three-month promo deal, so I’ve been printing all my purchased PDFs out.
A snap of our Gaslands tabletop starting line.
After going full geeked on it and kit-bashing my childhood into patinaed pulp, I started inviting friends over, and then those friends began inviting friends over as we doled out maximum carnage with our haphazard Hot Wheels. Any excuse to get grown-ups to play with their toy cars and laugh out loud for several hours is the only argument you need.
So, I started reflecting on the digital smash ’em ups in my catalogs, like Twisted Metal, Crazy Taxi, and (as LocalStriking1073
on the Gaslands subreddit reminded us) Carmageddon. I am a lifelong George Miller fan. It breaks my heart that Furiosa didn’t please the Hollywood overlords, so we may not get another like it for a long time, if ever.
After some poking around at my catalog, forums, and rabbit holes, here is our list of:
10 PC GAMES FOR FANS OF THE GASLANDS
MAD MAX
by Avalanche Studios
I really love this game, full stop. Sandbox (pun intended). Great action. Customization. Story and worldbuilding. It’s def a labor of love. The game emphasizes building and customizing Chumbucket’s “Magnum Opus” vehicle, scavenging for resources, and facing road gangs in a sprawling open world. It an underappreciated gem with visceral combat and super fun explosive desert drivin’.
DARK FUTURE: BLOOD RED STATES
by Auroch Digial
This is a port by Auroch Digital of the old – and too mechanically heavy for most – tabletop game of the same name from Games Workshop. This works out nicely in digital form, where fidgety accounting can be hidden under the hood.
This digital port combines car combat with strategy elements and is set in a dystopian future set in 2025. The opening video crawl is eerily prescient, talking about governments run by corporations, water and energy shortages, and mercenary police forces facing off with increasingly powerful gangs in a poisoned landscape rife with vigilantes, predators, and survivalists. You can upgrade all parts of your car and hire career drivers.
Command Mode lets you slow down time, issue tactical orders, match speed with other vehicles, deploy front and rear-facing weapons, 360 turrets, and more. At the same time, it’s one of the best alternatives to Gaslands for PC.
Platforms: Sony PS4, Microsoft XBox One, Windows PC, Mac, Linux, Steam
WARHAMMER 40,000: SPEED FREEKS
by Caged Element
Speaking of everyone’s favorite company these days, from PLAION, there’s a pretty solid newcomer as of August 2024 in which you and your Ork chums are out for the usual mayhem. Some folks lament the in-game currency, which is ubiquitous these days for purchasing in-game accouterments (a hilarious word when I write it here).
Others love the high-speed, sweet-looking action and miss a little Warsong Gulch capture the flag, deliver the football, and so on. The lobby wait can get a little long sometimes, but there are games to be had, and this is just coming out of Early Access with lots of significant player-informed patches adding QoL and heaps of new content hitting on a fairly frequent basis.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
DEATH ROADS: TOURNAMENT
by Knights of Unity
Wow this one is an almost literal port of Gaslands, except that it isn’t 1:1 and in fact add a creative deck-building card Roguelite component to the proceedings. You are on a Death Race across the Divided States of America, as illustrated in comic book style, and spend your tourney switching lanes, rear-bashing, SMG shooting with your hand of drawn cards, before using your Skid cards to play out the maneuvers that, in Gaslands, would be handled by the Skid Dice.
It works though. It may not make a lot of sense to a non-Gaslands player, but for one like me, it was super easy to pick up and a great proxy for the real thing.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam, GOG
CONVOY
by Convoy Games
Blending the tactical challenge of FTL: Faster Than Light with the post-apocalyptic feel of the great empty, this game focuses on managing a convoy of vehicles through a procedurally generated wasteland.
The mix of random events, real-time tactical combat, and survival decisions makes for a cool tactical and strategic experience, though folks say it can be overly punishing. Nonetheless, it’s fairly singular in its format and one that I dig for this kind of game. In Meatspace, you’d be looking at stuff like dice placement solo game Wreckland Run or Thunder Road: Vendetta.
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4, Microsoft Xbox One, Windows PC, Mac, Linux, Steam
LOW DESERT PUNK
by Outlaw
This sleeper came out as a tie-in to a desert rock album but caught my interest because of its hyperminimalist and comely black, white, and red aesthetic. Beholder eyes are collected as you deke out raider baddies on an austere background. It feels great to skid, slide, spin, and keep on rolling to the chunky-AF guitars. For 99 cents, it’s an easy win. File under: if Queens of the Stone Age album covers were interactive.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
GAS GUZZLERS: COMBAT CARNAGE
by Gamepires
This is a precursor to Gas Guzzlers Extreme, which is better reviewed but less aesthetically like Gaslands. Racing, pick-ups, and good wanton destruction will earn you cash to mod or upsell your car, kit it out with weapons, stickers, and paint jobs, and build a career in death-driving for yourself.
Another nice touch is the optional commentator, whose gruff insertions are good for a few chuckles to validate your crazy moves. Sure, they can get a bit repetitive, but I liked ’em.
GGCC’s high-speed races and destructive, fast-paced mayhem meet the criteria we so hungrily seek on this list despite, according to some, being less polished than its sequel. Plus, “maximum carnage” is a term directly derived from Gaslands. The cardinal rule is when in doubt, choose the option that creates maximum carnage. You can get it for a few bucks on Steam.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
BLOODY RALLY SHOW
by Kodo Linija
This game combines Rogue-like elements, combat racing, and procedurally generated tracks and campaigns. The dystopian story, AI-generated missions, and chaotic battles add replayability (ideally), though some folks say it can be the weak spot. Battle Mode and Weapon Zones offer extra variety.
I love how each of these games is like Gaslands in a different way. Besides being pretty great, Bloody Rally Show also looks like battle maps you find to lay out on your table for TTRPGs and skirmish games, which is like bringing them to life. You can try the free Prologue chapter on Steam.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Linux, Steam
MAKE WAY
by Ice BEAM
This game has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam and offers a cartoonish take on vehicular combat, loop-de-loops and a lighter, destructively fun experience similar to what you actually do when playing Gaslands IRL: moving modded 1:64-scale toy cars around your game table. With multiplayer mode, think Mario Cart meets the wastelands. So even though it’s a little less gritty, it makes up for it with madness.
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4/5, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Steam
FUMES
by FUMES Team
In the 11th hour, IGR writer TheOvermatt pointed me to FUMES, which is actually pre-Early Access at the time of this writing but looks like a bullseye candidate for this list. It also has a free demo you can download!
It features procedurally generated environments with rally-inspired physics, no loading screens, and an original guitar-heavy soundtrack. A pseudo-pointillistic rust aesthetic further sets it apart. It’s a kind of procedural sprite animation DOOM-like arcade action wasteland thing.
I’m looking for a little more depth and customization than this, but I loved being able to 360-degree my cannons, so I hit the mobs from all sides while in turbo. Worth keeping an eye on.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
BONUS:
DUST & DIESEL: DEADLAND DELIVERY
by Rejected Games
A promising-looking upcoming game from Playway (no date whatsoever yet) is Dust & Diesel: Deadland Delivery, which has a modernized graphic equivalent of Mad Max, but the car-building, highway attacking focus of Gaslands (which Mad Max does too, admittedly).
Developer Rejected Games is perhaps best known for its Mr. Pepper series, and Playway has built a business on simulators like House Flipper and Car Mechanic. They have had years of practice, so this could be a solid outing that legit gets under the hood.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
THE VERDICT:
In short, there is an absolute bounty out there.
I did have a few more on the list that I ultimately chose to leave out. Crossout was one of them because they are asking exorbitant prices to upsell you from the free base game, and there are a lot of complaints about bots. It’s too bad because it has a great look and creative vehicle designs.
While not a racing game, Gas Station SimulatorGas Station Simulator: Car Junkyard DLC by DRAGO Entertainment explores life in a gritty car junkyard salvaging, repairing, and customizing vehicles. You’ll source and rebuild vehicles, climbing the ranks of the car-dealing world. I think it’s a great alternate perspective on the trope.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
Hard Truck Apocalypse by Targem Games from the aughts was a minor breakout hit for what it was, but contemporary support is lacking, and stability is inconsistent. Maybe GOG will GOG it someday.
Heavy Metal Machines was a great diminutive free-to-play game hoping for a comeback, but financing issues and a botched takeover set them back. Hopefully, this terrific racing MOBA-style smash ’em up will find higher ground soon.
I also remember liking Wasteland Angel more than I probably should have…could be XBLA nostalgia. I also liked the comics that it incorporated. But ultimately, this top-down twin-stick comprised little more than a bunch of waves coming at you ad nauseum. Some liked it better than others. I was in the former category.
Even the very popular ARK: Survival Ascended dino hunting MMO has a new expansion called Bob’s Tall Tales features Wasteland War, released December 2024 that promises: “high-octane automobile action as you clash with rival tribes and scavenge for survival in this post-apocalyptic wasteland!” Early reviews are negative because of trouble activating the new content with existing accounts. Still, it looks rad, and hopefully, the issues will get straightened out soon.
Bob’s Tall Tales expansion for Ark: Survival Ascended by
Studio Wildcard, Grove Street Games, Instinct Games
You can also pick the classic version of Death Rally free on Steam. (Thanks to Sad-Entertainment336 at the /r/Gaslands sub for that tip.)
Ultimately, our journey along the track has proven that there is a bounty of material out there to keep the engines roaring and win you the fame, filthy lucre, and spare cans you seek. Some are even great.
I would love to hear about your faves, too.

40 DEVELOPERS WHO HAVE MADE A MARK IN THE INDIE GAME INDUSTRY,https://indiegamereviewer.com/40-developers-who-have-made-a-mark-in-the-indie-game-industry/,"GAME DEVELOPERS WITHOUT COMPROMISE
This list exists because there is no horizon in sight of the number of developers who have changed the path, inspired a generation, changed the life of just one person, and – whether known or unknown – become the very definition of tenacity, audacity, and miracle-working.
It is a living list. It will be expanded and updated. It does not aspire to be definitive, nor does it intend to be exclusive.
These are developers, writers, artists, directors, and producers that have changed the conversation…and that are changing the conversation. Contributors to the game industry that have defined it…and that are currently redefining it.
IGR felt it was time to make another such list. May it open some doors for you to explore, may it offer some mirrors in which you may see a version of yourself.
TRACY FULLERTON
Author of Game Design Workshop: A Playcentric Approach to Creating Innovative Games and professor at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts, Fullerton’s long career in the games industry began with early interactive film projects for such companies as Interfilm, for whom she co-directed Ride for Your Life (starring Adam West and Matthew Lillard), Synapse, and Spiderdance.
Her thoughtful, experimental approach to interactive media is evidenced by her work on pervasive games and interactive art installations like Reality Ends Here and The Night Journey, as well as Walden, a game, an award-winning walking simulator based on the writing of Henry David Thoreau.
KELLEE SANTIAGO
As founder of thatgamecompany, Santiago is responsible in part for such critically acclaimed releases as Flow, Journey, and Sky, but her contributions go beyond game design. Along with Jonathan Blow and Nathan Vella, among others, she helped create the Indie Fund to provide financial encouragement to upcoming developers, and later worked for the indie-friendly micro-console company Ouya.
And remember that time Roger Ebert went on a rant about video games not being art? That was a direct – albeit delayed – response to a TED Talk that Santiago delivered all the way back in 2009.
RIEKO KODAMA
It’s hard to imagine a time when a name as synonymous with video games as Sega could have been considered “indie,” but during the industry’s early days, even the biggest development teams and budgets would be considered paltry by today’s blockbuster standards.
Kodama (often credited as Phoenix Rie) was at the forefront of these years for Sega, producing, contributing art, and even directing now-legendary titles like Alex Kidd, Phantasy Star, Fantasy Zone, and of course the early Sonic the Hedgehog games. She remained a producer at the company and regularly championed the role of women in the industry until her untimely death at 58 in 2022.
DANIELLE BUNTEN BERRY
Bunten Berry’s work as a game developer started in 1978 with Wheeler Dealers, a multi-player auction game for the Apple II computer.
Her most notable release, multi-player strategy game M.U.L.E., has been incredibly influential in the subsequent four decades since its 1983 release for the Atari computer, especially in terms of multi-player functionality and simulated economic systems.
BRENDA ROMERO
During her career, Romero has worked on such seminal projects as the Jagged Alliance and Wizardry games, more recently working in the indie arena with such games as Gunman Taco Truck and Prohibition-era crime RPG Empire of Sin as well as a series of experimental board games called The Mechanic Is the Message. She has also written several books about the game industry.
An anti-censorship activist, Romero is particularly interested in the intersection between games and sexuality, as evidenced both by her book, Sex in Video Games, and Playboy: The Mansion, a Hugh Hefner sim she designed in 2005.
NINA FREEMAN
The creator of such games as Kimmy and Beach Date, Freeman’s work stands out for its combination of familiar game mechanics with slice-of-life vignettes and autobiographical material that can be so intimate and true-to-life it feels almost voyeuristic, as in Cibele, a slightly fictionalized account of a relationship that took place in part through an MMORPG.
Freeman has also founded her own studio, Star Maid Games, and did level design for Tacoma at Fullbright.
ROBIN MOULDER
Cofounder of 3lb Games (and former bass player and founding member of legendary alternative rock act Jack Off Jill), Moulder is a major force in the XR and VR world, creating original games like Vault of Stars, Grokit, and Space Dragon as well as providing consulting on VR applications for other companies.
Among other projects, her studio is responsible for the VR port of Slime Rancher, an IGR favorite and winner of our Top Indie Game of 2017.
NONNY DE LA PEÑA
De la Peña known for her pioneering work in immersive journalism. As the founder of Emblematic Group, she focuses on creating innovative virtual, mixed, and augmented reality experiences. Her approach, which melds Unity graphics with real audio, has revolutionized the way users interact with virtual reality.
De la Peña’s immersive journalism experiences like “After Solitary,” “Out of Exile,” and “Project Syria,” have garnered critical acclaim and multiple awards, and her achievements have been recognized at prestigious festivals and events, including Sundance, the Venice Film Festival, and SXSW.
BRENDA LAUREL
With a career that started in the 1970s with work for the CyberVision and Atari platforms, Laurel has also worked for Activision and consulted on a number of LucasArts Entertainment projects.
She founded her own company, Purple Moon, which focused on developing games for pre-teen and adolescent girls via the Rockett and Secret Paths series, and has also been incredibly influential in early work studying virtual reality and interactive design through her work with Interval Research Corporation and Telepresence Research, a company she cofounded with USC professor Scott Fisher.
LORI COLE
Lori Cole, alongside husband Corey Cole, is half the two-person design team responsible for the Quest for Glory series, a high-water mark for adventure/RPG games thanks to clever but irreverent writing and carefully designed mechanics.
While the biggest studios have largely abandoned this particular style of adventure/RPRG, the Coles have more recently moved to the indie arena with such spiritual successors as Summer Daze: Tilly’s Tale and Hero-U: Rogue to Redemption.
KEIKO ERIKAWA
A founder of now-major Japanese publisher Koei in the 1970s, what really cements Erikawa’s role in indies is that while leading an all-female development team, Ruby Party, she co-designed what are considered the very first Otome games: visual novels targeted specifically to women.
Otome games remain a staple of both the indie and mobile scenes to this day, thanks in no small part to the trailblazing work of Erikawa and her peers.
JANE MCGONIGAL
A pioneer in alternate reality games, McGonigal has worked on such projects as I Love Bees, World without Oil, and SuperBetter.
She has also written several books, including Reality Is Broken: Why Games Make Us Better and How They Can Change the World, which argues for the potential of games as a device for social change.
CAROL SHAW
A programmer hired by Atari straight out of her Master’s program in 1978, Shaw worked for them for several years before relocating to a relatively new company called Activision in 1982.
She is often credited as one of the first female game designers in the entire industry’s history and is best known for River Raid, one of the earliest games to use random enemy and item placement and thus an early influence on action Rogue-lite games.
REBECCA HEINEMAN
A programmer and Space Invaders tournament champion who learned how to reverse-engineer Atari 2600 code as a teenager, Heineman went on to co-found Interplay.
She would go on to on many of the company’s titles, including now-legendary games like Wasteland, The Bard’s Tale, and Out of This World, most of which have had outsized influences on the indie RPG world.
CHRISTINE LOVE
Founder of studio Love Conquers All Games, Love is a writer and game designer of thematically complex visual novels like Analogue: A Love Story and Analogue: A Hate Story.
Love has expressed the belief that the indie game movement has done a better job depicting LGBTQ experiences than larger studios, as evidenced by Ladykiller in a Bind, which she describes as “an erotic visual novel about social manipulation and girls tying up other girls,” and her latest game, Get in the Car, Loser!, which combines a lesbian road trip story with JRPG elements.
ANNA ANTHROPY
Anthropy is another game developer whose work centers on LGBTQ themes; one of her first games, Lesbian Spider Queens of Mars, is a BDSM-themed tribute to 1981’s Wizard of Wor.
In addition to development work, Anthropy is also the author and editor of multiple books about the indie game community and game development.
KIM SWIFT
Kim Swift entered the industry with Narbacular Drop, a student/indie project with a unique “portal” mechanic that caught the eye of Valve Software and led directly to Swift’s most famous release, Portal.
Swift’s later work has focused on cloud-native streaming games for Google Stadia and – more recently – Microsoft.
ZOË QUINN
Providing narrative design for such games as Framed and Solar Ash, Quinn is perhaps best known for Depression Quest, an interactive fiction piece about mental health issues.
They founded the nonprofit organization Crash Override (which later merged with the Online Abuse Prevention Initiative) to deal with the issue of Internet harassment, which they also addressed in their Hugo-nominated book of the same name.
LUCY MORRIS
Morris is the founder of New Zealand’s Starcolt, part of the Alliance Media studio group alongside such indie game luminaries as Zachtronics.
With the tagline “We deal in feels,” Starcolt’s design philosophy is centered on empathic, emotional experiences, as evidenced by their first release, Best Friend Forever, a combination pet care and dating sim.
ERIN REYNOLDS
Reynolds has feet in both the large studio world – she’s in senior management at Walt Disney Games – and the indie games world as founder of Flying Mollusk, a developer focused on emerging technology, including but not limited to VR.
Her studio’s flagship release, Nevermind, combines virtual reality and biofeedback that double as both suspenseful adventure game and stress management tool.
MEGAN FOX
Creator and brainchild behind Glass Bottom Games, Fox embarked on her coding journey at just 11 years old, epitomizing the innovative spirit of indie game development. The name of her studio is a meaningful nod to the challenges often encountered by women in the gaming sector, underscoring her determination and advocacy.
Skatebird from Glass Bottom Games
Among her notable creations is SkateBIRD, a game where players embody a small yet spirited skateboarding bird determined to uplift its Big Friend’s spirits. This game, along with others like Spartan Fist and Hot Tin Roof: The Cat That Wore A Fedora, showcases Fox’s talent for weaving engaging stories with charming characters, marking her works as distinctive in the indie gaming world.
MITU KHANDAKER
Khandaker first rose to prominence as founder and solo developer of The Tiny Shark, the studio behind Redshirts, a parody of social media culture inspired by Red Dwarf and Star Trek.
More recently, Khandaker cofounded Glow Up Games, a mobile and XR studio, and released Insecure: The Come Up, in collaboration with HBO and featuring actress Issa Rae.
ALLISON JAMES
James is an incredibly prolific developer within the GameMaker Studio community, releasing seemingly countless games on the GX.games platform.
As cofounder of Chequered Ink, she has released such titles as Pong Quest – an arcade/RPG mash-up backed by Atari – Gyro Boss DX, Won’t You Be My Laser?, and Maddening Euphoria, and is known for an approach that pays playful homage to classic arcade mechanics.
JENNY XU
Operating primarily in the mobile arena, Xu founded JCSoft and has released multiple titles, including the Can You Escape series of experimental arcade games and the Five Tries at Love dating sim series, amassing well over nine million downloads.
Her newest venture, Talofa Games, partnered with Pokémon Go developers Niantic to release Run Legends, an augmented reality fitness program that combines Xu’s love for games and long-distance running.
LANA LUX
Lux is a true solo developer, handling everything from 3D asset creation to programming for her upcoming apocalyptic survival game, Strain. But it’s her Twitch channel that sets her apart, giving a rare inside view of process. Her award-winning stream – Lux won last year’s Unity Streamer award – also helps funds the game’s development through such sponsors as Microsoft, Unity, and Capital One, highlighting the alternative funding approaches available to today’s indie developers.
She shared an inspiring talk about tenacity, discipline and navigating the challenges of being a woman developing an indie game alone at the VRTO conference in 2023 that brought the crowd to its feet.
KATHRYN YU
A promising new developer in VR gaming, Yu has already won numerous awards for games like Heirloom and Penrose Station, her thesis game at USC’s School of Cinematic Arts. She recently worked on Virtual Virtual Reality 2 for Tender Claws.
In addition to her work as a developer, Yu cofounded the Immersive Experiences Institute, a nonprofit organization devoted to immersive and interactive art.
HEATHER MAXWELL CHANDLER
With credits on over three dozen games, Chandler has extensive production experience both in such mainstream titles as Fortnite and the Tom Clancy’s Ghost Recon series and on indie projects like Never Alone (Kisima Ingitchuna) and Beyond Blue.
She is also a prolific writer who has authored several guides on game development and production.
NATHALIE LAWHEAD
Heavily inspired by zine culture and ’90s-era computer art and web design, Lawhead’s experimental work in game design with such projects as Tetrageddon Games and Everything Is Going to Be OK has won numerous awards.
Everything Is Going to Be OK! – screenshot courtesy IndieCade
She recently reissued her BlueSuburbia interactive poetry project, initially a Flash website created in 1999, as a 3D open world project for this year’s IndieCade festival.
JERI ELLSWORTH
Jeri first made waves in 2004 with the innovative Commodore 30-in-1 Direct to TV, a joystick-based Commodore 64 emulator. Pivoting to augmented reality gaming, Ellsworth co-founded CastAR and later Tilt Five, focusing on advancing AR technology in gaming.
Her successful Kickstarter campaigns for these projects highlight her influential role in the hardware side of indie game development.
HILARY MASON
Currently operating within a Venn diagram that encompasses game design, data science, and AI, Mason founded machine learning company Fast Forward Labs, later acquired by data management company Cloudera.
Her current company, Hidden Door, is building a narrative AI platform that can convert fictional worlds into social role playing experiences in what she describes as “Roblox meets D&D.”
LENA RAINE
Raine is best known for as a composer for such indie favorites as Celeste, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, Deltarune, and Minecraft.
She is also a developer in her own right, releasing ESC, a philosophical interactive fiction piece, in 2018.
CAMILLE KANENSLEY
A digital artist working on the cutting edge of VR gaming, Kanensley has worked on such games as Final Space: The Rescue and Knockout League for Grab Games.
She is the founder of FreeForm Labs, developers of ElemenTerra, a virtual reality world-building simulation.
NANA MOON
Solo developer Moon’s games are influenced by classic JRPGs in terms of their mechanics and a devotion to complex narratives and exquisite art direction, as evidenced by the science-fantasy Virgo vs. the Zodiac and the forthcoming cyberpunk-themed Keylocker.
DARYA NOGHANI
British solo developer Noghani is already making a mark in the indie game scene with a knack for exposing human foibles via urban animal characters, first via Victorian legal sim Avian Attorney and more recently with Redwall-meets-Final Fantasy turn-based RPG Small Saga.
ANDY WOOD
Co-founder of Toronto indie studio Lithic Entertainment, Wood is best known for her work on Dwarrows, a fantasy city-building sim.
More recently, she worked on Arthurian VR puzzle-platformer A Knight in the Attic from Mighty Yell.
ERIN REILLY
A professor of media and entertainment at the University of Texas at Austin’s Moody College of Communication, Reilly’s academic work focuses on such emerging technologies as virtual and augmented reality, but she’s also the founder of ReillyWorks, a company currently developing interactive and augmented reality games.
TIANI PIXEL AND FERNANDA DIAS
Pixel and Dias are the two-person team behind Pixel Punk Studio, the developers of action-RPG Unsighted, one of our Top 10 Indie Games of 2021.

LAUREN CLINNICK
Clinnick is the founder and CEO of Lumi Games, the studio behind Kinder World, a mobile game combining plant care sim, self-care reminders, and the Cottagecore aesthetic that is currently in Early Access.
JANE NG
One of the industry’s top 3D environment artists, Ng has worked on a number of Double Fine Productions titles like Stacking and Costume Quest. More recently, she worked on Firewatch, the award-winning park ranger sim from Campo Santo.

KONG: SURVIVOR INSTINCT,https://indiegamereviewer.com/kong-survivor-instinct-a-game-review/,"KONG is a looker. No, not the big ape (though he is a handsome fella, no doubt), but I mean the world design. We are spoiled these days. Shaders, lights, textures, and physics combine to make deliciously edible dioramas you want to reach into the screen and pick up. The scenery is so beautifully done that it’s a peril of the genre we just run past.
I had the same problem with Trine 2 – I often got entranced by the scenery so much that I didn’t want to clear the level. INSIDE was a looker too, but its subdued monochromatic look dragged you forward like a comic book as it told its story.
If you played or are familiar with This War of Mine, you’ll be in familiar territory here. To a point. Minus the real-world gravity of the powerful and essential message that game explored, the form factor is roughly the same. A 2D side-scrolling action adventure game.
That said, the game is wonderfully simple to play. While the game strongly encourages a controller—any controller—before the titles even come up, the keyboard is mapped to well-established standards: A and D to move L and R, W to climb a ladder, D to descend it, SPACE to jump, CTRL to crouch or drop-down, E to interact, and LMB to smash things. It’s just like riding a bike through the destroyed suburbs leading into the city.
The dread, the aftermath of the destruction, loom everywhere, but once you finally meet the big guy (which is not very far in), it’s…incidental. It’s as though the game is more about the post-apo world wrought by the monkey, but not the monkey itself. The protagonist is almost blase about almost being trampled by a 6-story-tall angry gorilla of legend. Oh well.
So let’s just pretend Kong has nukes, widespread climate change effects, or whatever. It really doesn’t matter.
But as you go, you find dockets about characters and then the Titans roaming the Earth, and it turns out the chimp isn’t such a bad guy. (If you know anything about Kong, you will likely know this.)
Combat has a few moves – block, parry, strike, grapple.
If you die from that or fall off a ledge, you will have to restart from the last checkpoint. Sigh. I hate this. Yes, there should be some penalty for failure states, but redoing the level and the fights isn’t that fun. Maybe if there were more dynamically generated. It’s standard platformer stuff. So be it. It’s just not that interesting to redo, especially because it’s not Super Mario Bros or Super Meat Boy.
Anyway, it might sound like I am not digging it. But that would be on me; I really like it. It takes me back to the XBOX Arcade days. It feels like XBOX Arcade days, playing Shadow Complex, but with graphics brought up to modern-day standards. (Shadow Complex graphics were great, by the way.)
The sound design is good, and the ambient music is inoffensive. All interactions have nicely curated, subtly implemented corresponding SFX. I mean, those shaders and textures are cached, right?
The shaders are great. It’s oddly slow to load up, though. Maybe I just noticed it because I played the game in shorter bursts.
Once you find them, you get a journal, an objective map, a dossier of unlocked character data, and fast travel checkpoints. All the conventions you’d like are implemented.
Eventually, you will get a gun. It’s useful for more than shooting people. Cool note: where you shoot them matters. Shoot ’em in the leg; they stop standing up. Shooting them in the head, they go down hard. Neat.
It then becomes more apparent why Kong isn’t as menacing, but I’ll leave that for you to discover. But you will be able to summon Titans for various reasons. You won’t just be backtracking on a 2.5D urban art showcase.
The journal and character dossiers fill, new objective types are added, and fast travel becomes more meaningful. It is generally a joy to play. Nothing too fancy or difficult, but that can be viewed as an enjoyable kick-back creature feature, not a giant fire-spouting bug.
If you like any of the games I’ve listed throughout this review (maybe Super Meat Boy is not a good comp), then you might like this. If you haven’t, it’s still worth checking out.

INDIE GAME REVIEWER'S TOP 10 INDIE GAMES OF 2024,https://indiegamereviewer.com/indie-game-reviewers-top-10-indie-games-of-2024/,"What are we supposed to do here? There were hundreds – if not thousands – of incredible indie releases in 2024. We see you, Pacific Drive, Felvidek, Thank Goodness You’re Here, Crow Country [play fast-forward animation through dozens of contenders, accompanied by a tape-speeding-up sound effect].
We chose games that were set apart by novel and well-implemented mechanisms, joy-inducing visuals, emotional outcomes, and exemplary design. We favor bold choices and risks; we try to cover a diverse palette of ideas.
After much discussion, the consensus arrived at the following ten games, in descending order. We also chose our annual sacrificial lamb – an indie outlier so rare and so acclaimed that it doesn’t need another nudge from us.
We followed with each of IGR’s personal writer’s picks for the year that didn’t make the list in hopes it opens a door for you, dear reader. And with that, we humbly present:
INDIEGAMEREVIEWER.COM’S TOP 10 INDIE GAMES OF 2024
10. THRONEFALL
by GrizzlyGames
“If Citizen Sleeper was my Steam Deck game of 2023, then Thronefall was my number one pick for 2024. It is to tower defense what Vampire Survivors is to an RPG SHMUP: easy to use, tough to master. The delightful, whimsical, and Lilliputian design belies a deep tactical complexity and advanced UX to make any designer take note. A triumph of game design.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
“Even a complete strategy dummy like me can play this, and it’s somehow engrossing despite that, so kudos to the developers!” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
9. POOLS
by Tensori
“While walking simulators, found footage horror, or the new darling ‘liminal games’ are nothing new, POOLS from Finnish developers Tensori somehow managed to merge them all, rise above the noise, and penetrate into primal Lynchian subconscious territory.
Mostly dread simulator, part anomaly game, and definitely Unity showcase, this hypnogogic numinous wonderworld preys on the same neuronal circuits that make Pennywise a bad choice for children’s birthday parties. The game, here, is wholly internal…who are you, what are you made of, why are you made this way, and what are you willing to venture in order to find out?” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
8. ARCO
by Franek, Max Cahill, Bibiki, Fáyer
“Arco understands how minimalism can support rich world-building, deep character emotion, complex and thrilling combat, and evocative scenery by leaning on the power of imagination to fill in the rest.
With an eye-level take on Mesoamerican and indigenous South American cultures, the game is set in a speculative North American frontier that feels as authentic as a tamal made by your grandma; it was developed by an international team comprising Polish pixel artist Franek Nowotniak, Australian game developer Max Cahill, Spanish composer and sound designer José Ramón ‘Bibiki’ García, and Mexican developer Antonio ‘Fayer’ Uribe.
Its unusual and original take on pseudo-turn-based tactical combat adds the pressure cooker of your haunted past moving in to crush your spirit if you take too long to make a decision, while dodging enemy attacks plays like real-time arcade action. The narrative is unflinching in its violence and pathos, and 8-bit NPCs are granted enough nuance to hurt when raiders murder them. Hours went by before I looked up. Pixel game of the year for me.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Windows PC, Steam
7. INDIKA
by Odd Meter
“Indika stood out to me because it tackles religion head-on, which is why I was surprised when it got nominated at Games For Impact. It’s basically [SPOILER]: A woman’s tale about falling out of religion, putting faith in a supposed religious object, which ultimately was a lie, realizing that at the end, and rejecting it all.” ~ FICTiVETRUiSM
“What could be an arthouse film about reflection on a life devoted to God becomes an artisanal reckoning with identity, meaning, subordination, ontology, and the nature of consensus reality. The meticulous audiovisual design supports a grim and whimsical experience that is sublime and grotesque, absurd and profound. Bold swing, and it’s out of the park.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Steam
6. MOUTHWASHING
by Wrong Organ
“There are very few games as meticulous as Mouthwashing. It has one of the most intriguing and thought-provoking narratives I’ve ever come across. It deals with themes like assault, mental health, narcissism, and corporate greed. It’s all tackled elegantly in a concise and enthralling experience filled to the brim with clever symbolism.
Surreal visuals mixed with an unreliable narrator make you question what’s really happening. Its strikingly moody atmosphere throughout makes the cabin fever tale feel so much more foreboding. It’s a unique experience, and one I won’t soon forget.” ~ FICTiVETRUiSM
“I could hardly pilot my way through the terse, unorthodox path of nightmare fuel before I found the mettle and was greeted by a sharply satiric, self-aware, complex, artistic work reminiscent of Event Horizon, Solaris, and Pony Island. Indeed, if Tarkovsky made punk indie games, this might be the product.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
5. 1000XRESIST
by Sunset Visitor
“I truly didn’t know what to expect going into 1000xResist, and I’m still not quite sure how to do it justice with a description. What I’ve settled on is that it’s a compelling narrative adventure with big ideas, even bigger questions, and something that’s given me plenty to chew on well after the credits rolled.
Above all else, it’s a story about generational trauma, the value of resistance, and learning from the past, all wrapped in the wildest religion-fueled apocalyptic sci-fi shell this side of Evangelion. I swear you’ve never played anything like this before.” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Windows PC, Steam
4. TACTICAL BREACH WIZARDS
by Suspicious Developments
“Some of the most compelling turn-based tactics action this side of XCOM, combined with genuinely funny writing and an engaging story of espionage meets absurd wizard lore. You’ll laugh, you’ll shoot, you’ll laugh as you shoot people out windows.” ~ TheOvermatt
“Let’s begin with the fact that I have been an XCOM 2 stan since the day it spawned. I own it on every device where it can be played. So I like me some tactics. I also love magic fantasy/sci-fi crossovers like Shadowrun. I mean, heck, I even liked Bright. But what tipped me over the edge with Tactical Breach Wizards is the writing. It is consistently not only laugh-out-loud funny but sharp as a tack in every respect, from its pacing to its design. You know those games where all the parts come together so tightly that it just feels like it has always been there? It is indeed a high point for the genre.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
3. NEVA
by Nomada Studio
“The level of artistry across the board from creators of popular indie darling Gris is immediately evident as Neva spreads its beautiful illustrative multiplanar animation across the screen.
From the outset, the delicate and wonder-filled world is superimposed with authentically creepy dark menace, and the relationship between the player character (‘Alba’) and her titular sidekick/ward, Neva, belies an unconventional push-and-pull relationship of camaraderie, curiosity, collaboration, mutual care, and surrender. The way attention is refocused and gently guided is one for the study books, and the consistently detailed and imaginative world-building and character design is itself worth the cost of admission. Dare we say this is a new instant classic.” ~ Indie-Game-Freak
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4/5, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
2. NINE SOLS
by RedCandleGames
“RedCandleGames have been on my radar since Detention back in 2017, but even I was surprised when they announced their newest game was dropping Taiwanese horror for ‘Taopunk’ hack-and-slash exploration. Thankfully, I needn’t have been worried, because Nine Sols masterfully combines the Metroidvania formula with fast, vicious combat in the vein of Sekiro and a genuinely compelling story about the cost of revenge. It truly deserves all the success it’s found, and more.” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4/5, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
1.  ANIMAL WELL
by Billy Basso
“Fans of the Metroidvania genre have been eating particularly well in the indie scene for some time now, but Animal Well shows that an old dog can absolutely learn new tricks. Between its palpable aura of mystery, brilliant level design, and the fact that its secrets only continue to unravel after you finish the game, this is probably the biggest sense of wonder I’ve felt with an entry in this genre since playing Super Metroid for the first time back in 1994. Absolutely essential.” ~ The Overmatt
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Steam
THE SACRIFICIAL LAMB: BALATRO
by LocalThunk
Every year there is a game that so outpaces every other in terms of critical and popular attention that we sacrifice it to the altar of once-in-a-blue-moon outliers. Think Minecraft, Super Meat Boy, Vampire Survivors. In 2024 that game was Balatro, made by a clandestine singular developer living in the Canadian prairies. Here is our take:
“Balatro joins its peers like Vampire Survivors among the pantheon of ‘Nothing this addictive should be allowed to be this cheap.’ Something as simple as Rogue-like poker is turned into the stuff of genuine addiction thanks to the absurd amount of game-breaking Joker cards and strategies to try out, not to mention the fact that it keeps getting additional content for free. Buying the mobile version of this is possibly the best thing I’ve ever done for my sense of enjoyment and easily the worst thing I’ve ever done for my productivity. It’s incredible. Don’t say I didn’t warn you.” ~ TheOvermatt
Platforms: Android, iOS, Nintendo Switch, Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
STAFF PICKS:
INDIE-GAME-FREAK’S PICK: SOVEREIGN SYNDICATE
by Crimson Herring Studios
Welp, I never know what it’s gonna be, but this year the game that just kept bubbling up in my thoughts was the fairly austere but simultaneously ornate clockwork urban fantasy Victorian esoteric alchemical time-and-body-jumping CRPG starring minotaurs in top hats adventure, Sovereign Syndicate.
While simultaneously confounding and titillating, I was dragged forward with an irrepressible curiosity for what I would experience next. Much like the wildly original novel The Failures by Benjamin Liar, I was in fresh creative territory and approached with full commitment. Most patches in the past year have been localization-specific, and gosh, this game is being played in many countries. All told, Sovereign Syndicate was something I just couldn’t stop wondering about. Some even call it the clockwork Disco Elysium. It’s a a generous stretch, but hey, not bad company to be lumped in with.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
KIT GOODLIFFE’S PICK: FROSTPUNK 2
by 11 bit studios
Frostpunk 2 builds on the achievements of its predecessor by adding more moving parts to its elegant story-generating systems. Tough decisions must be made in order to survive, and each of them shapes the burgeoning society of New London in ways both anticipated and surprising.
With the addition of factions that must be appeased and manipulated in order to nudge civilization in the desired direction, Frostpunk 2 has conjured a convincing politics simulator that, unusually for the genre, conveys not just the logistics but the human consequences as well. In doing so it provides a carefully balanced hybrid of guided and emergent storytelling that seizes the advantages of its medium to good effect.
Platforms: Sony PS5, Microsoft Xbox, Windows PC, Mac, Steam
FICTIVETRUISM’S PICK: SORRY WE’RE CLOSED
by à la mode games
As a big survival horror game fan, Sorry We’re Closed quickly became one of my favorites in the genre. It’s a narrative-driven game about fallen angels and demons who have to coexist in a world with everyday humans.
Its gameplay feels like a tense but forgiving mix between Killer 7 and Silent Hill. But what struck a chord with me the most was its story. Even though its setting is fantastical, it manages to still be grounded and relatable, mainly because of how earnestly it explores its main theme, which revolves around love: how love can change us, what it means to lose it, how it can be the catalyst for us to be better…and the sacrifices that may come with that.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
AMANDA BOWER’S PICK: MINDS BENEATH US
by BearBone Studio
Minds Beneath Us blends a cyberpunk universe with immersive storytelling in a way that makes it stand out amongst those in a similar genre. The atmosphere and creative art style stole my heart from the beginning, but I was especially captivated by the characters and their narratives. Given the opportunity to “choose your own adventure”, so to speak, Minds Beneath Us excels in allowing players to elect significant dialogue options.
Want to be kind to a stranger? Awesome. Would you rather be a dude no one likes? That’s fine, too. The dystopian world illuminates the imminent dangers of AI and unveils some secrets of a company that may have gone too far. To say Minds Beneath Us is one of the most brilliant stories I’ve had the pleasure of enduring this year is an understatement; it’s really something special.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
THE OVERMATT’S PICK: MULLET MADJACK
by HAMMER95
Mullet MadJack is pure chaos in a way that other shooters could only dream of. Between its Rogue-like structure, gleefully excessive visual style that borrows everything great about ’90s anime OVAs, and gameplay that literally doesn’t give you time to think (only react), this is adrenaline distilled into digital form, like some kind of hybrid of amphetamines and Cyber City Oedo 808. I don’t blame anyone who finds it too much to parse, but if you yearn for the days of getting a sugar rush on Skittles and renting something WAY too adult from the anime section at Blockbuster like I do, this is just the fix you need.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
INFINITYWALTZ’S PICK: A WINTER HAUNTING
by AB
Everlyn’s first encounter with the Lunabelle Mansion
On top of its exquisitely eerie atmosphere, A Winter Haunting succeeds on the strength of its puzzles. Some environmental, some inventory, and some pure logic puzzles, they’re perfectly balanced to engage, not enrage, and they all feel natural to the game’s story and haunted house setting. That haunted house – not to mention its adjacent lake and woods – is also a treat, spooky and seasonal in a wintry way that’s distinct from our Halloween favorites but scratches a similar itch. We often send out holiday cards with Charles Addams or Edward Gorey illustrations, and the faceless characters, intricate Edwardian interiors, and stylized snowdrifts of this game are reminiscent of that same aesthetic.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
AEREYN’S PICK: THE CABIN FACTORY
by International Cat Studios
The Cabin Factory is a masterclass in atmospheric horror, a simple, engaging concept, and immersive sound design. It stands out among other anomaly games because every clue, whether terrifying, intriguing, or delightful, feels purposeful. Sometimes, this genre can get bogged down in the boring and mundane, inspecting minute differences in wallpaper and upholstery.
By fully embracing the genre’s strengths, each anomaly sparked a different story in my mind, amplifying the sense of mystery and unease. The stark, repetitive nature of the gameplay works brilliantly to build tension as the once-familiar becomes unsettling and paranoia creeps in. The hauntings themselves can be deadly, but even more chilling is the possibility of missing something vital to the story or worse, being sent packing, having to start my shift all over again with new nightmares and secrets to be discovered.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam

THE STRANGE STORY OF BRIAN FISHER: CHAPTER 2 REVIEW - PUZZLE PLEASURES,https://indiegamereviewer.com/the-strange-story-of-brian-fisher-chapter-2-review-puzzle-pleasures/,"THE STRANGE STORY OF BRIAN FISHER: CHAPTER 2 BY INTECT
In the past, I’ve played video games that presented unruly puzzles that were more of an annoyance to complete than a reward. On the other hand, The Strange Story of Brian Fisher: Chapter 2 bestows players with intellectual riddles that are gratifying to solve.
CHILL TO THE NEXT EPISODE
Developed and published by Intect, The Strange Story of Brian Fisher: Chapter 2 is a direct sequel to the 2020 release of detective Brian’s original introduction to the puzzle-mystery realm.
Admittedly, I haven’t experienced the first chapter of Brian’s journey. However, stepping directly into Chapter 2 did not bring about as much confusion as I originally thought. I’m sure some of the story elements could have been cleared up had I not skipped a chapter, but alas, The show must go on.
Brian is seemingly transported back to being a child and has no recollection of how he appeared in the strange house he now occupies. In all honesty, the voice acting seems unnatural and isn’t appealing. You also aren’t able to examine items while Brian is commentating over his younger self’s revelations.
You can either skip the narrative altogether and miss out on some important key points to Brian’s memory or sit back and listen. Sometimes I lacked patience, but I was happy to unveil Brian’s history alongside him.
This puzzle was so frustrating, yet so much fun to FINALLY solve.
PERFECT PUZZLES
The Strange Story of Brian Fisher: Chapter 2 excels with its brain-teasers. They’re the perfect combination of challenging and achievable. I became so utterly addicted to one of the puzzles that I simply could not walk away until it was solved. Intect provides a sense of fulfillment that made me eager for the next riddle.
Though short in length, there are a handful of captivating moments embellishing young Brian’s past. Mentions of his scientist father echo through various discoveries. Secrets of the universe lie within the solution to every puzzle.
Sometimes, though, the constant introduction of riddles distracts from the development of Brian’s narrative. It feels like Chapter 2 wants to go all-out with both puzzles and a rich, enigmatic story, which can be challenging to achieve within such a short amount of time.
THE VERDICT
The Strange Story of Brian Fisher: Chapter 2 is enjoyable for anyone who finds pleasure in solving puzzles. Now that I’ve mustered my brain to complete Chapter 2, I may have to indulge in its predecessor, where it all began. I can only hope that the next installment provides a gratifying balance between puzzles and immersive storytelling.
The Strange Story of Brian Fisher: Chapter 2 is available via the Microsoft Store and Steam.

ENIGMA OF FEAR REVIEW - A FEARFULLY AMBITIOUS PARANORMAL PUZZLER,https://indiegamereviewer.com/enigma-of-fear-review/,"ENIGMA OF FEAR BY DUMATIVA
In Enigma of Fear from developer Dumativa, Mia is a detective who’s no stranger to the paranormal. She grew up with a father who did that exact type of research himself as part of a research group known as Ordo Realitas…but something has gone wrong.
Mia’s father has traveled to a mysterious place and has gone missing. It’s up to Mia, with the help of her dog Lupi, to find her father and learn more about this mysterious place known as the Perimeter.
From the start, Enigma of Fear draws you into its unfolding narrative, inviting you to uncover the history of this mysterious place and the secrets of the Ordo Realitas research team. Beyond traditional cutscenes and dialogue, the story unfolds through atmospheric tools like found audio recordings, scattered notes, and environmental storytelling.
These elements are woven together by the developers, to encourage the aforementioned keen detective-work needed to piece together the events that have shaped the world. The world-building is amplified by its cast of characters and the detailed history, creating an immersive experience.
A PERFECT CIRCLE
The Perimeter is an intriguing place to explore, featuring a mix of locations like a castle, a maze-like graveyard, an underground facility, and a crystal cave. These varied settings help keep the experience from becoming stale, with enough variety to maintain interest.
Each area feels distinct, avoiding a repetitious slog and providing a solid foundation for the game’s paranormal investigation themes.
The large, nonlinear open map stands grants you the freedom to explore areas in whatever order your curiosity drives you. The ambitious design choice is handled well, offering a liberating exploratory spirit throughout the game.
DOORWAYS TO ADVENTURE
The game manages a nice balance of puzzle-solving, exploration, and combat. Its exploration feels akin to an old PC adventure game. Puzzles involve figuring out door codes and matching symbols to get past otherworldly devices. They’re relatively easy but tricky enough that they may require you to grab a pen and paper.
Combat feels similar to a survival horror game: It’s straightforward enough to complete the job. Attack with a crowbar or shoot your enemies with a pistol. If anything it leans towards feeling too stiff and, above anything else, requires proper positioning to succeed. Since movement is also pretty stiff, it makes juking enemies and dodging big boss attacks less fun than it could be.
THE MEDIUM
Thankfully, the game has a helpful locking system, which allows for a manageable experience. And although serviceable, the combat is the weakest aspect of the game, only because everything else is much stronger.
Since it’s a horror-style game, you might assume things would get difficult. Thankfully, the game is forgiving regarding saves, as it saves checkpoints frequently. The experience feels more about uncovering its weaving narrative than creating a survival horror-style punishment.
I did run into a couple of bugs when playing. There was a bug where my dog Lupi would get stuck on geometry. I had another bug where I’d disappear and have to quit to the main menu to reload it. But thanks to the aforementioned forgiving save system, there bugs weren’t a big deal.
They happened often enough to be hard to ignore. That being said, it was never anything game-breaking. And for an ambitious game as this, bugs are to totally surprising. As of writing this review, thankfully, the developers are actively patching the game to iron out the bugs.
The game features some nicely detailed environments with superb lighting effects. It’s atmospheric in the best ways. For the spooky game genre, atmosphere is always important. And this game nails its vibe perfectly.
Using an isometric camera adds a close-but-far-enough viewpoint to appreciate all the small details everywhere, from pictures on the wall of a tarnished room to human bones in a musty cave. It all adds so much to the world’s setting.
The game implements a cool, haunting use of pianos, violins, cellos, and moody synths for its music. This unnerving, fitting space feels like you’re falling into an endless void in slow motion. It’s so evocative and makes for an eerie but sometimes calming experience.
THE VERDICT
Enigma of Fear is an ambitious action puzzle game that will entertain you throughout. It’s not perfect because of some bugs and a basic combat system. But its atmospheric world is fun to explore thanks to its mystery-filled narrative. For puzzle fans and horror enthusiasts, check this one out.
Enigma of Fear is available via Steam.

10 PC GAMES TO SCRATCH THAT GASLANDS ITCH,https://indiegamereviewer.com/10-pc-games-to-scratch-that-gaslands-itch/,"VEHICULAR MAYHEM: 10 GAMES FOR FANS OF GASLANDS
I’ve been positively munching my way through as many great tabletop skirmish games as I can get my hands on, often via print-and-play and 3D printing.
Despite being my favorite genre, the post-apocalyptic Gaslands from game designer Mike Hutchinson and published through Osprey Games’ blue book series didn’t move the needle for me until a few more skirmisher types put it at the top of their list. I decided it was time to give it another look. I’ve been printing like a maniac on my Bambu A1 printer, and my HP Instant Ink plan is on a three-month promo deal, so I’ve been printing all my purchased PDFs out.
A snap of our Gaslands tabletop starting line.
After going full geeked on it and kit-bashing my childhood into patinaed pulp, I started inviting friends over, and then those friends began inviting friends over as we doled out maximum carnage with our haphazard Hot Wheels. Any excuse to get grown-ups to play with their toy cars and laugh out loud for several hours is the only argument you need.
So, I started reflecting on the digital smash ’em ups in my catalogs, like Twisted Metal, Crazy Taxi, and (as LocalStriking1073
on the Gaslands subreddit reminded us) Carmageddon. I am a lifelong George Miller fan. It breaks my heart that Furiosa didn’t please the Hollywood overlords, so we may not get another like it for a long time, if ever.
After some poking around at my catalog, forums, and rabbit holes, here is our list of:
10 PC GAMES FOR FANS OF THE GASLANDS
MAD MAX
by Avalanche Studios
I really love this game, full stop. Sandbox (pun intended). Great action. Customization. Story and worldbuilding. It’s def a labor of love. The game emphasizes building and customizing Chumbucket’s “Magnum Opus” vehicle, scavenging for resources, and facing road gangs in a sprawling open world. It an underappreciated gem with visceral combat and super fun explosive desert drivin’.
DARK FUTURE: BLOOD RED STATES
by Auroch Digial
This is a port by Auroch Digital of the old – and too mechanically heavy for most – tabletop game of the same name from Games Workshop. This works out nicely in digital form, where fidgety accounting can be hidden under the hood.
This digital port combines car combat with strategy elements and is set in a dystopian future set in 2025. The opening video crawl is eerily prescient, talking about governments run by corporations, water and energy shortages, and mercenary police forces facing off with increasingly powerful gangs in a poisoned landscape rife with vigilantes, predators, and survivalists. You can upgrade all parts of your car and hire career drivers.
Command Mode lets you slow down time, issue tactical orders, match speed with other vehicles, deploy front and rear-facing weapons, 360 turrets, and more. At the same time, it’s one of the best alternatives to Gaslands for PC.
Platforms: Sony PS4, Microsoft XBox One, Windows PC, Mac, Linux, Steam
WARHAMMER 40,000: SPEED FREEKS
by Caged Element
Speaking of everyone’s favorite company these days, from PLAION, there’s a pretty solid newcomer as of August 2024 in which you and your Ork chums are out for the usual mayhem. Some folks lament the in-game currency, which is ubiquitous these days for purchasing in-game accouterments (a hilarious word when I write it here).
Others love the high-speed, sweet-looking action and miss a little Warsong Gulch capture the flag, deliver the football, and so on. The lobby wait can get a little long sometimes, but there are games to be had, and this is just coming out of Early Access with lots of significant player-informed patches adding QoL and heaps of new content hitting on a fairly frequent basis.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
DEATH ROADS: TOURNAMENT
by Knights of Unity
Wow this one is an almost literal port of Gaslands, except that it isn’t 1:1 and in fact add a creative deck-building card Roguelite component to the proceedings. You are on a Death Race across the Divided States of America, as illustrated in comic book style, and spend your tourney switching lanes, rear-bashing, SMG shooting with your hand of drawn cards, before using your Skid cards to play out the maneuvers that, in Gaslands, would be handled by the Skid Dice.
It works though. It may not make a lot of sense to a non-Gaslands player, but for one like me, it was super easy to pick up and a great proxy for the real thing.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam, GOG
CONVOY
by Convoy Games
Blending the tactical challenge of FTL: Faster Than Light with the post-apocalyptic feel of the great empty, this game focuses on managing a convoy of vehicles through a procedurally generated wasteland.
The mix of random events, real-time tactical combat, and survival decisions makes for a cool tactical and strategic experience, though folks say it can be overly punishing. Nonetheless, it’s fairly singular in its format and one that I dig for this kind of game. In Meatspace, you’d be looking at stuff like dice placement solo game Wreckland Run or Thunder Road: Vendetta.
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4, Microsoft Xbox One, Windows PC, Mac, Linux, Steam
LOW DESERT PUNK
by Outlaw
This sleeper came out as a tie-in to a desert rock album but caught my interest because of its hyperminimalist and comely black, white, and red aesthetic. Beholder eyes are collected as you deke out raider baddies on an austere background. It feels great to skid, slide, spin, and keep on rolling to the chunky-AF guitars. For 99 cents, it’s an easy win. File under: if Queens of the Stone Age album covers were interactive.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
GAS GUZZLERS: COMBAT CARNAGE
by Gamepires
This is a precursor to Gas Guzzlers Extreme, which is better reviewed but less aesthetically like Gaslands. Racing, pick-ups, and good wanton destruction will earn you cash to mod or upsell your car, kit it out with weapons, stickers, and paint jobs, and build a career in death-driving for yourself.
Another nice touch is the optional commentator, whose gruff insertions are good for a few chuckles to validate your crazy moves. Sure, they can get a bit repetitive, but I liked ’em.
GGCC’s high-speed races and destructive, fast-paced mayhem meet the criteria we so hungrily seek on this list despite, according to some, being less polished than its sequel. Plus, “maximum carnage” is a term directly derived from Gaslands. The cardinal rule is when in doubt, choose the option that creates maximum carnage. You can get it for a few bucks on Steam.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
BLOODY RALLY SHOW
by Kodo Linija
This game combines Rogue-like elements, combat racing, and procedurally generated tracks and campaigns. The dystopian story, AI-generated missions, and chaotic battles add replayability (ideally), though some folks say it can be the weak spot. Battle Mode and Weapon Zones offer extra variety.
I love how each of these games is like Gaslands in a different way. Besides being pretty great, Bloody Rally Show also looks like battle maps you find to lay out on your table for TTRPGs and skirmish games, which is like bringing them to life. You can try the free Prologue chapter on Steam.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Linux, Steam
MAKE WAY
by Ice BEAM
This game has Overwhelmingly Positive reviews on Steam and offers a cartoonish take on vehicular combat, loop-de-loops and a lighter, destructively fun experience similar to what you actually do when playing Gaslands IRL: moving modded 1:64-scale toy cars around your game table. With multiplayer mode, think Mario Cart meets the wastelands. So even though it’s a little less gritty, it makes up for it with madness.
Platforms: Nintendo Switch, Sony PS4/5, Microsoft Xbox One, Microsoft Xbox Series X/S, Windows PC, Steam
FUMES
by FUMES Team
In the 11th hour, IGR writer TheOvermatt pointed me to FUMES, which is actually pre-Early Access at the time of this writing but looks like a bullseye candidate for this list. It also has a free demo you can download!
It features procedurally generated environments with rally-inspired physics, no loading screens, and an original guitar-heavy soundtrack. A pseudo-pointillistic rust aesthetic further sets it apart. It’s a kind of procedural sprite animation DOOM-like arcade action wasteland thing.
I’m looking for a little more depth and customization than this, but I loved being able to 360-degree my cannons, so I hit the mobs from all sides while in turbo. Worth keeping an eye on.
Platforms: Windows PC, Steam
BONUS:
DUST & DIESEL: DEADLAND DELIVERY
by Rejected Games
A promising-looking upcoming game from Playway (no date whatsoever yet) is Dust & Diesel: Deadland Delivery, which has a modernized graphic equivalent of Mad Max, but the car-building, highway attacking focus of Gaslands (which Mad Max does too, admittedly).
Developer Rejected Games is perhaps best known for its Mr. Pepper series, and Playway has built a business on simulators like House Flipper and Car Mechanic. They have had years of practice, so this could be a solid outing that legit gets under the hood.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
THE VERDICT:
In short, there is an absolute bounty out there.
I did have a few more on the list that I ultimately chose to leave out. Crossout was one of them because they are asking exorbitant prices to upsell you from the free base game, and there are a lot of complaints about bots. It’s too bad because it has a great look and creative vehicle designs.
While not a racing game, Gas Station SimulatorGas Station Simulator: Car Junkyard DLC by DRAGO Entertainment explores life in a gritty car junkyard salvaging, repairing, and customizing vehicles. You’ll source and rebuild vehicles, climbing the ranks of the car-dealing world. I think it’s a great alternate perspective on the trope.
Platforms: Windows PC, Mac, Steam
Hard Truck Apocalypse by Targem Games from the aughts was a minor breakout hit for what it was, but contemporary support is lacking, and stability is inconsistent. Maybe GOG will GOG it someday.
Heavy Metal Machines was a great diminutive free-to-play game hoping for a comeback, but financing issues and a botched takeover set them back. Hopefully, this terrific racing MOBA-style smash ’em up will find higher ground soon.
I also remember liking Wasteland Angel more than I probably should have…could be XBLA nostalgia. I also liked the comics that it incorporated. But ultimately, this top-down twin-stick comprised little more than a bunch of waves coming at you ad nauseum. Some liked it better than others. I was in the former category.
Even the very popular ARK: Survival Ascended dino hunting MMO has a new expansion called Bob’s Tall Tales features Wasteland War, released December 2024 that promises: “high-octane automobile action as you clash with rival tribes and scavenge for survival in this post-apocalyptic wasteland!” Early reviews are negative because of trouble activating the new content with existing accounts. Still, it looks rad, and hopefully, the issues will get straightened out soon.
Bob’s Tall Tales expansion for Ark: Survival Ascended by
Studio Wildcard, Grove Street Games, Instinct Games
You can also pick the classic version of Death Rally free on Steam. (Thanks to Sad-Entertainment336 at the /r/Gaslands sub for that tip.)
Ultimately, our journey along the track has proven that there is a bounty of material out there to keep the engines roaring and win you the fame, filthy lucre, and spare cans you seek. Some are even great.
I would love to hear about your faves, too.

THE CABIN FACTORY REVIEW - PARANORMAL QUALITY CONTROL,https://indiegamereviewer.com/the-cabin-factory-review-paranormal-quality-control/,"THE CABIN FACTORY BY INTERNATIONAL CAT STUDIOS
The Cabin Factory is a horror walking simulator and anomaly game inspired by liminal space games like Pools, The Exit 8, and The Backrooms and yes, that famous cabin in the woods.
Clocking in for a shift at The Cabin Factory
INSPECT, REJECT, SURVIVE
The premise is simple. You arrive for your shift at the Cabin Factory. Your job is quality control. You will inspect each cabin as it comes down the conveyor belt. These are meant to be scary, but they only want simulated hauntings for a theme park. You have to inspect them to make sure that all is well. Any movement or anything that differs could mean it is indeed haunted and must be rejected. You have a quota to make to be successful.
The instructions are simple, but right off the bat, there is a sense of unease. You are alone under the fluorescent lights of the warehouse. It seems like you are being watched, but there is no interaction. This is a solo job. The first cabin is shunted down the line, and it’s time to start your shift.
Seems simple enough
MANNEQUINS AND MAYHEM
In The Cabin Factory, you inspect the same cabin repeatedly. If you find differences, it may be haunted, especially if a movement is out of the ordinary. There seem to be unlimited versions of this cabin.
You will sometimes be lulled into a false sense of security after inspecting the seemingly same cabin several times over. It’s always spooky, though. The cabins are always dark inside with the sound of a snowstorm outside. Some movement is always there, such as drifting dust motes lazily flickering by the fire in the stove and quilts hanging from the eaves that sway ever so gently.
But the sound design is designed to play tricks on you. Are those footsteps up above? Did a door just creak open? You have to inspect every inch of the cabin, and the anticipation and dread that build is real!
TRICKS OF THE LIGHT
The Cabin Factory was made with Unreal Engine 5, and it’s beautifully done and leaning towards photorealism. The darkness and shadows caused by the flickering firelight play tricks on the eyes and make it palm-sweatingly unnerving to go up that dark staircase and investigate. There are moments of pure terror where I screamed out loud several times.
You can turn off jump-scares if you want, and I recommend trying it both ways. I found at times that the horror of the cabin was purely psychological and didn’t need anything overt. When you leave the cabin, you have to either clear it or reject it for being haunted, and many times I cleared a cabin only to discover that I had gotten it wrong, lost my streak, and would have to start all over again. This was frustrating but also made me more eager to explore and discover what I had missed.
Sometimes, you have to run for your life. And sometimes, you have to figure out your next move and even solve some puzzles.
What Haunted Assembly Line Horror lies within?
THE VERDICT
The Cabin Factory is a must-have for fan of horror games. I “finished” the game in two different ways, and apparently, there are more different endings to be discovered. I’ve only scratched the surface, and for that, I am glad! I loved every horrifying moment and will keep trying to discover new hauntings.
I wish I could show some of the scary surprises and mind-bending thrills and chills, but that would spoil the surprises. The Cabin Factory is an original take on the ‘liminal space’ horror genre and somehow manages to keep the terror fresh even though you are inspecting multiple copies of the same setting. It will keep you guessing long after you clock out for the day.
The Cabin Factory is available via Steam.

DUNGEON DECK REVIEW - DECK THE TORMENTED HALLS,https://indiegamereviewer.com/dungeon-deck-review-deck-the-tormented-halls/,"DUNGEON DECK BY INCINIOUS
The Rogue-like deckbuilder is officially here to stay, spurred on by the success of landmark titles like Slay the Spire and Monster Train.
Alongside its siblings in boomer shooters and Metroidvanias, it seems like it’ll be some time before indie audiences tire of this trend.
Enter something like Dungeon Deck, which is walking into a crowded marketplace, to put it lightly. Can it carve out its own niche amidst a sea of similar titles?
TO DUNGEONS DEEP
As a denizen of a medieval tavern full of colorful characters, you’re quickly brought into the world of Dungeon Deck. The in-universe card game that is. Can you become the champion everyone yearns to challenge?
Dungeon Deck (the video game) is likely to be comfort food for anyone who enjoys deck-builders. Every session starts with you building a deck out of randomly selected cards, doing your best to keep your choices synergistic with each other.
After that, it’s off to the dungeon, represented by a card deck full of encounters. Different dungeon themes bring different unique rules, and you’ll need to complete several in a row in order to win the game.
You’ll fight monsters by playing weapons, shields, and spells, and end up rewarded with a new card for your deck after each one. There are encounters that let you buy and sell cards, upgrade them, trade them for buffs, and even remove them to thin your deck. Each deck ends with a boss encounter, after which it’s off to the next deck of your choice.
HANDS OF STEEL
As you’ve probably guessed by now, Dungeon Deck’s gameplay loop is very similar to that of its peers. However, there are a few things that make it stand out.
For starters, its charming, laid-back aesthetic invites more casual play and time investment. This is accented with little touches like being able to interact with objects on the table by your cards. It’s a charming addition that gives the game a lot of character (I personally love stacking my coins).
It’s also a streamlined experience that’s good for newbies and low-commitment players. The main choices are what cards to choose and which deck to approach after you finish the current one. If you’re someone who finds the micro-management of other deck-builders overwhelming, this might actually be a good fit for you.
THE VERDICT
Dungeon Deck doesn’t reinvent the genre, and it might be a hard purchase to justify if you’re already waist-deep in this kind of game. However, between its charming aesthetics and still genuinely fun, streamlined approach, I think it absolutely has a spot at the deck-builder Rogue-like table.
It may not blow your mind, but I guarantee it’ll make you smile, and sometimes that’s all we need.
Dungeon Deck is available via Steam and Itch.io.

BACK THEN REVIEW - WHAT MEMORIES LEAVE BEHIND,https://indiegamereviewer.com/back-then-review-what-memories-leave-behind/,"BACK THEN BY OCTOPUS EMBRACE
“For who do we become when we forget who we are?”
Back Then is a poetic journey outlining a man’s experience with Alzheimer’s. From a first-person perspective, you navigate through what appears to be the varied seasons of the writer Tom’s life.
No actual memories or instances are featured, but rather voices familiar to Tom comment as he tries to maneuver the daunting world of dementia. The eerie and emotive recollections will grip at your heartstrings, but the slow and sometimes confusing gameplay can be a drawback.
DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE
Developed and published by Octopus Embrace, Back Then is an empathic portrayal of what it might feel like to be an elderly person who has Alzheimer’s.
Beginning in a snowy forest, you slowly saunter down a path. Both female and male voices can heard, one extremely dark and ominous.
No faces are ever shown throughout Back Then except for photographs sprinkled in, so at times you’re unsure of Tom’s recollections. But perhaps that’s the point: dementia is perplexing that way.
A lot of Back Then is solving puzzles and finding key items to trigger a memory. It’s easy to get turned around in the larger environments, and the riddles can be a bit of a headscratcher. Tom’s lifelong home is the primary zone of discovery, notes plastered on the walls and doors reminding him of where things are.
If you look down, you can tell he occupies a wheelchair during these sequences. Naturally, he moves a little slowly, so getting from point A to point B can feel a little sluggish.
Some elements of Tom’s journey echo Spiral, another story-rich Alzheimer’s tale I played that reminisced on sentimental memories of a fellow named Bernard. The concept here is similar: environments become distorted or turned upside down, emphasizing the protagonist’s discomposure.
REGRETS AND MISSED OPPORTUNITIES
He hears his caring daughter’s voice reflecting on – and yearning for – the past. His son’s regretful voice sounds through the phone, stumbling to blurt out the words “I love you” to his father.
Back Then captures the complicated emotions of “should haves” and “what ifs” that everyone considers at the end of a loved one’s life. The growing fear Tom observes through forgotten memories also becomes apparent as you progress onward.
Though every journey with dementia differs, Tom clings to love and displays a tender heart. How can you not adore his persona? I know I did.
The game is seemingly split into chapters or “seasons” and only saves your progress once one is completed. I made the mistake of quitting the game before completing a season and had to restart the chapter entirely. Luckily, chapters aren’t terribly long.
However, key items don’t exactly stand out, nor does the objective, so being mindful of Tom’s surroundings helps pick up the pace.
A few cryptic environments highlight the darkness that inevitably clings to dementia. A region representing war embodies a somber atmosphere, bringing to light Tom’s sorrowful childhood. Back Then accentuates how Alzheimer’s is not a one-way street, and it’s illustrated well.
THE VERDICT:
Back Then is a short exploration experience that offers a first-hand look at Alzheimer’s. Ambling aimlessly around the various mazes and locations made it feel like I wasn’t getting anywhere.
However, it didn’t deter too much from the engaging dialogue and artistic charm. Most of all, Back Then hits a high note with an evident message: turn to love, and everything will be okay.
Back Then is available via the Sony PlayStation Store and Steam.

A WINTER HAUNTING REVIEW - HAUNTINGLY BEAUTIFUL AND DELIGHTFULLY CHALLENGING,https://indiegamereviewer.com/a-winter-haunting-review/,"A WINTER HAUNTING BY AB
A Winter Haunting is an enchanting point-and-click adventure and puzzle game by AB, a talented indie female game developer.
It is full of all the things I love: an atmospheric, possibly haunted old mansion; beautiful landscapes; interesting rooms with cabinets full of mysterious and magical objects; charming fashions; flowers; animals; mushrooms; and ghosts!
The game seamlessly weaves together challenging puzzles, a gripping supernatural mystery, and stunning artistry. The lush landscapes and elegantly designed, paper-doll-like characters set a dreamy, immersive tone that pulls you deep into the narrative.
Everlyn’s first encounter with the Lunabelle Mansion
A VINTAGE ADVENTURE WITH MODERN DEPTH
You play as Everlyn Sterling, a young woman undergoing a difficult and fruitless job search. Your grandmother asks you to become the caretaker of the ancestral mansion. A brief tutorial option at the beginning acts as a prequel to the game, making it an enjoyable part of the story while also teaching you the game mechanics.
I really appreciated a feature that reveals all the interaction hotspots by pressing “H” because there is a lot to explore in this game. You receive a list of tasks at each level, but you must explore each level to uncover the clues and items that will help you accomplish your tasks.
The world of A Winter Haunting is beautifully stylized and graceful for a simple point-and-click game. In spite of Everlyn being a thoroughly modern woman, the setting has a sweetly old-fashioned vibe.
Sweet Summer Child Everlyn discovers an ancient landline telephone!
YOUR CHOICES SHAPE HOW THE MYSTERY UNFOLDS
As the title of the game implies, the story definitely delves into the supernatural. The sound of the winter wind moaning in the eves creates a sense of unease, and so do the mysterious objects and dusty portraits in every room. There is also a dark forest that must be explored for clues.
The puzzles are complex and will test your skills. I found myself taking notes and even getting stuck on a particularly tricky mystery involving matrix multiplication.
I’m in trouble!
After many attempts, I managed to move past it with help from a playthrough video. Math isn’t my strong suit, but there were plenty of other puzzles that were! There is something for everyone.
I started a few different games and saved my progress. When I finally finished the game, I was delighted to realize that the choices I had made throughout the game contributed to the story and determined the ending. I confirmed this by returning to my game’s earlier saved versions and making different choices.
This is my favorite part of the game because you can play it again and have noticeable agency in the story.
THE VERDICT
A Winter Haunting is thoroughly enjoyable. I was immersed and invested in the story in a way I haven’t experienced in a long time. It’s one of those rare games where I had goosebumps when I solved the mystery and felt very emotional. Every frame of this game shows the love and attention put into creating it.
I recommend this to anyone who loves mysteries and puzzles and appreciates beautiful game art that is both whimsical and unique. I am interested in future endeavors from AB!
A Winter Haunting is available via Steam.

TENSEI REVIEW - ZEN AND THE ART OF DRAGON TRANSFORMATION,https://indiegamereviewer.com/tensei-review-zen-and-the-art-of-dragon-transformation/,"TENSEI BY PROJECT PEGASUS
Every once in a while a game comes along that reminds me that these things can be great as a relaxation tool. No EXP to grind, no bullets to dodge, just crisp visuals, simple gameplay, and lovely visuals to help you reach a place of Zen. Tensei by developers Project Pegasus is one such game, and a strong one at that.
DRAGON’S FLIGHT ACROSS THE WAVES
Tensei places you in an endlessly vertical Zen landscape full of mountains, hot springs, blowing tall grass, and temples. Your one goal? Ascend until you can’t anymore.
As an innocuous (and weirdly cute?) little black sphere, you have a number of options to make your way further and further towards the heavens. Your ability to triple-jump is quite pronounced, you’re able to roll up any and all surfaces (including walls), and your bounce ability gives you plenty of extra lift you need to reach even greater heights.
Along the way, there’s plenty to interact with, including orbs that power you up, launch rings that fire you into the air, and bits of corruption that threaten to halt your progress. Interacting with any of these (including destroying the latter with your bounce) charges a meter at the bottom of the screen. Fill it up, and you transform into a dragon, soaring with rapid speed and eliminating any corruption in your path for a few seconds. Rinse and repeat until you decide to stop.
HEART OF A DRAGON
While Tensei might not sound like much in terms of its gameplay, it’s the experience overall that really marks it as something special. The simple but addictive gameplay gets elevated by its gorgeous production. The black and white visuals look and feel like living brushwork, and seeing things like changing seasons as you ascend through the world is a real treat.
This is all accompanied by a serene soundtrack that accentuates the action perfectly. Simply put, I haven’t played a game this relaxing in a long time.
If one thing might turn some people off, it’s that I’ve basically described the entire game here. Aside from some achievements to collect and scores to beat, most of your games of Tensei are going to feel much the same. It’s not likely to become your next late-night marathon game, but I also don’t think it’s trying to.
THE VERDICT
At the rock-bottom price of $3, it’s hard not to recommend Tensei. You’re probably already pretty sure if this is for you or not, but if you’re curious, I firmly encourage you to open your mind and find your wings.
Tensei is available via Steam.

SORRY WE'RE CLOSED REVIEW - LOVE IS HELL,https://indiegamereviewer.com/sorry-were-closed-review-love-is-hell/,"SORRY WE’RE CLOSED BY À LA MODE GAMES
Sorry We’re Closed takes place in a world akin to ours – except some humans are demons or angels in disguise.
They exist alongside each other, but demons and angels don’t typically spend much time together…and for good reason: if they fall in love, they can be forever changed into humans, making their infinite lives finite.
To complicate matters, an archdemon known as The Duchess is looking for love in questionable way: trying to convince humans to fall in love by practically stalking them. The Duchess is a compelling antagonist and makes the world and plot even more intriguing.
It’s an engaging narrative in a world filled to the brim with lore. It’s impressive how thorough the game is in this regard. It feels fully realized, well thought out, and – most importantly – compelling. I talked to every NPC I had the chance to just to learn more about the world and its inhabitants.
LOVE IS A REAL DEVIL
Love is a core pillar of the game’s narrative. You can affect relationships between NPCs that you can affect along with advancing or hindering your relationship with The Duchess.
Love even plays a role in the backstory with certain bosses. Love is often the catalyst that drives them forward, or in some instances the reason they are afraid. This aspect sets Sorry We’re Closed apart from other games in the genre, and it explores the theme in fascinating ways.
Narrative-altering choices dictate how the story plays out as well as which ending you receive, and each option in these narrative forks is tempting. Sorry We’re Closed does a good job of adding ambiguity and making these choices difficult. It definitely begs to be played multiple times to see how each decision alters the story.
SIGHT AND SURVIVAL
As a survival horror fan, many of the core mechanics feel familiar: managing healing items and ammo, deciding whether to run past enemies or kill them, and exploring unsettling and enemy-filled environments along the way.
What sets Sorry We’re Closed apart from its contemporaries is its third eye mechanic, which allows the protagonist to open up her third eye to reveal an alternate, true version of reality within a circle around her. Environments change, and the third eye allows you to see the true forms of some NPCs around you.
This mechanic is also core to combat. You can turn on your third eye and see an approaching enemy’s weak points, allowing you to deal out way more damage. Aiming at their weak points while they are close adds some extra challenge because you have to be fast enough to shoot all their weak points before they hit you.
It adds a nice amount of tension that compounds even more when facing multiple close enemies at once. I really like this mechanic; clearing out a crowded room, hitting every enemy’s weak points, and avoiding getting hit is always satisfying.
CLUMSY CLUBBING
This mechanic isn’t perfect. Using the melee weapon is unsatisfying because of a slight delay between hitting the button and actually hitting the enemy.
When playing with a controller, moving the reticle to hit weak points is difficult and imprecise, so in these instances, I’d switch to keyboard and mouse for better precision. This happened a couple of times, especially during certain boss fights.
In terms of difficulty, Sorry We’re Closed leans on the easier side. The game is very generous with ammo, for example. When I say this game is survival horror, don’t expect much tension in that regard, but that isn’t a problem, since it’s a more narrative-driven experience.
HEAVENLY FUN, DEMONIC STYLE
As far as pace and fun factor, Sorry We’re Closed is outstandingly crafted. Each area is unique and ties into the game’s narrative. Boss fights feel grandiose and cool, each with its own catchy hip-hop track.
There’s a well-balanced mix of combat and narrative, with chase sequences, environmental hazards, and light puzzle-solving sprinkled here and there. The game does a fantastic job of mixing up the gameplay in interesting ways to keep things feeling fresh. It’s a fun, varied ride from start to end.
Sorry We’re Closed also features one of the most striking visual styles I’ve seen in a while. Each NPC is unique and interesting; even their character portraits during dialog sequences pop.
They’re also modeled fantastically, each lovingly designed. Demons look fittingly horrifying and weird. I adore this game’s overall look, and it’s a core piece of what sets it apart.
THE VERDICT
Sorry We’re Closed is one of the best games I played all year. It’s a narrative-driven survival horror game that nails what it set out to do. It creates a thought-provoking, engaging narrative while also creating a fun survival horror experience.
This is a game that shouldn’t be missed, and as a big survival horror game fan, it’s now one of my favorites in the genre.
Sorry We’re Closed is available via Steam.

"THE NIGHT IS GREY REVIEW - POINT, CLICK, RUN FROM THE WOLVES",https://indiegamereviewer.com/the-night-is-grey-review-point-click-run-from-the-wolves/,"THE NIGHT IS GREY BY WHALESTORK INTERACTIVE
The Night Is Grey is a traditional point-and-click adventure game following Graham, an unfortunate man lost in a dark forest with a pack of wolves on his tail.
He soon stumbles across a young child called Hannah, seemingly left alone in the woodland cabin she calls home. Together they set out to get to the child’s grandparents and to safety.
The Night is Grey features all of the staples of classic point-and-click adventures: a combination of carefully crafted animations, appealing location art, exploration, slow-burn narrative, and puzzles. Graham himself is a well-conceived protagonist, conveying a kind of weariness coupled with an awkward but charming sense of humor that feels recognizable in the circumstances he faces.
The puzzles in The Night Is Grey follow a familiar pattern for fans of the genre. Most depend on finding items and often combining them in the inventory to craft the necessary tools to progress.
POINT-AND-CLICK PERKS AND QUIRKS
There are some quirky little moments where the game pokes fun at itself (or its genre); at one point, I needed a pen to leave a note and resorted to seeking charcoal from the fireplace; Graham thought about it but decided it was absurd and that he should just find an actual pen like a sensible person.
The puzzles are largely straight forward and the game has the kindness to provide hints here and there when the challenge ramps up. It’s always possible to bring up an overlay showing all of the objects on screen that can be interacted with, which helps when trying to figure out where to go next.
One small niggle with the interface is that the inventory drops down from the top when the mouse cursor is there, and some objects of note occupy the same space, making it fiddly to click on them without instead opening the inventory.
GREY, GRIM, AND GORGEOUS
The story itself is well-paced and unfolds slowly. It mixes a sense of danger with just enough levity to remain inviting while a dark undertone builds in the background, suggesting things are not all as they seem and awful truths wait to be discovered.
It crafts a somber atmosphere that serves to keep the story compelling even during its slower segments.
The Night is Grey is beautiful to look at; the animation is exquisite and the attention to detail is worthy of respect. Little details like Graham dropping a match into water only for it to sizzle at his feet help to enrich the presentation enormously.
The location art is also excellent, providing an array of atmospheric places to explore and puzzle through. This is all backed up with a solid soundtrack that offers a range of eerie ambiance to serve the setting.
THE VERDICT:
The Night is Grey is a worthy entry in the point-and-click adventure genre, providing a beautifully crafted world and engaging characters to explore.
The art is stunning from top to bottom, and it’s used to good effect to present an appealing but dark world that serves as an absorbing backdrop to the adventure of traveling through its titular night.
The Night Is Grey is available via Steam.

INDIECADE 2024 NIGHT GAMES AT THE MUSIC CENTER IN LOS ANGELES,https://indiegamereviewer.com/indiecade-2024-night-games-at-the-music-center-in-los-angeles/,"OH WHAT A NIGHT
IGR has covered IndieCade for years, and this year, we were so happy to attend the Night Games in person again!
Held in collaboration with the Los Angeles Music Center, Night Games is a chance to play games under the stars. There was music, glowing lights, plenty of squishy sofas and bean bag chairs, and lots of games. The sense of wonder, childlike fun, and the chance to let down your hair and be silly permeated the atmosphere.
Check out the full 2024 lineup of games to play.
Oh What a Night!
DIVE IN
You can’t be shy at Night Games; you have to be bold and ask to play, often with total strangers.
Playing together in person breaks down barriers. Pretty soon, you are shouting and laughing at your ludicrous attempts, cheering on other players and offering to take pictures for them.
My friend and I tried as many games as we could. Night Games filled up fast, and the lineups got longer and longer, but we had gotten there early and fueled up with food and drinks, so we were fortified and ready to play.
Jungle Jym by jwhop was a series of multiplayer sports-like games with a whimsical twist. Turtle Tag and Beet Down were my favorites. In Beet Down, which is an all-out beetle wrestling match, each player controls their own drum track, which makes every wrestling match a unique percussive experience.
Beet Down by Jungle Jym
Sloppy Forgeries by Playful Systems LLC had a long line, but watching it was fascinating. Players choose a classic painting like Van Gogh’s Starry Night or Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl Earring. They then have three minutes to recreate their version of the masterpiece.
At the end, the game scores each attempt for accuracy, and the winner is declared. You have a mouse, a color palette, and different thicknesses for fine detail. It’s such a simple concept but made for some very serious attempts and much hilarity. My friend and I attempted the Mona Lisa, and he won! I think mine was a tad too abstract.
Sloppy Forgeries by Playful Systems LLC
The game that wowed us the most attracted a lot of attention because it required a seesaw with built-in controllers and separate screens for each player.
Back Off Me Booty, developed by a team of student game devs from the University of Utah, is a two-player game that can be played with or without the seesaw. In it, you play as a team of pirates attempting to keep your ship of pirate treasure out of the hands of other pirates or various sea monsters. You must work as a team on the seesaw to tackle enemies attacking you on both sides of the ship.
We lined up for an hour for the chance to play, and it was so much fun to see everyone playing. They even had some pirate hats for participants to wear.
We were just about to board the ship when the People’s Choice Award was announced from the Night Games Stage — it was for Back Off Me Booty! The game devs ran up to accept their award and then came right back so we could try out the award-winning game!
It did not disappoint. We wildly careened up and down and defended our ship from the Kraken and rival pirates. We also got a killer leg and “booty” workout. I want to get one for my living room.
Arrrrrr! “Back Off Me Booty”
AN EMBARRASSMENT OF RICHES
We left feeling slightly giddy, like kids who had been let loose in a toy store. Night Games is a rare opportunity to play with neighbors and enjoy letting loose. You don’t have to worry about looking silly because that’s the point. It’s precisely the sort of shenanigans that imaginative playtime pioneer Bernie DeKoven (whom IndieCade named an award after) would have hoped for and helped to foster.
These are trying times, but a good game makes you remember joy, cooperation, letting go, curiosity, discovery, community, even if only for a little while, and Night Games understands the assignment.
Thank you to IndieCade and the Music Center for putting on such a great event, and congratulations to all the game developers who brought the magic! I’m already looking forward to next year!

TWISTED LOGIC: ABBOTSFIELD REVIEW - EXORCISE YOUR WITS,https://indiegamereviewer.com/twisted-logic-abbotsfield-review-exorcise-your-wits/,"TWISTED LOGIC: ABBOTSFIELD BY PROPULSION GAMES
Twisted Logic: Abbostfield is the sixth game from Propulsion Games, an indie game studio in Hampshire, England. They focus on making games that make readers “read, think, and laugh,” And their latest offering ticks all these boxes!
A GAME FOR THE SHARP-MINDED
You are a professional exorcist from the Office of Unexplained Phenomena. This is not your first rodeo! In the introduction, you learn that there have been multiple reports of paranormal activity, and an exorcism is required to restore peace and put angry spirits to rest.
The game has a set of case notes to download and study, including background information on family members, a history of the family and property, and possible spirits causing trouble. The head exorcist gives you one hour to find six totemic items within the house and conduct the ritual exorcism.
EXORCISING YOUR WITS
This is no easy, breezy ghost hunt. I initially skimmed through the case notes and confidently started exploring the dark house in the woods…during a thunderstorm of course.
This will not end well!
Armed with nothing but a trusty flashlight, I discovered the only unlocked door on the ground floor was the door to the basement. Wonderful. Am I the only one who turns off the basement lights and then runs like heck up the stairs? You never know what or who might grab you by the ankle and drag you back down.
A Ouija board gave me some additional clues, and I had to scramble for a pen and paper to write down all the messages from the other side. The basement also had a circle of salt with some black candles. The case notes informed me that this is where I would conduct the exorcism once I’ve found the items needed.
Dare to meddle with the spirit world?
EXORCIST OR DETECTIVE?
Twisted Logic delivers plenty of ghostly thrills and chills. The 3D graphics are highly realistic, and the truly ghoulish effects genuinely scared me and added to the spooky atmosphere.
Is that a ghost? Or are your eyes playing tricks on you?
You can hear the rain on the roof, the wind in the trees outside, and the occasional clap of thunder. But you can also hear other things: are those footsteps on the stairs behind you? Who opened that door?
You can pick up almost everything in Twisted Logic – every picture, book, dish, Christmas present – examine them, and either put them back or take them. Snoop to your heart’s content!
I picked up everything that looked even vaguely “totemic” so that I would have all the required objects by default, but I quickly discovered that the inventory has limited slots. Once it’s full, you can’t pick up anything else.
I always check out medicine cabinets!
Twisted Logic is truly a mystery to be solved. You must solve the clues in order to find the required items, and you must do it within an hour or the exorcism will fail, and the portal to the other side will remain open.
The game doesn’t end until you go back down to the basement to do the ritual. If you don’t have the correct objects or if you have taken too long, the ritual will fail and you will have to start over again.
PUZZLING THROUGH THE MYSTERY OF ABBOTSFIELD
I have spent quite a few hours trying to unravel the mysteries of this game. I am still studying the case notes and even took a quick course on ciphers offered in the case file!
I love mystery novels, detective shows, and anything to do with the paranormal. If you do, too, this game will provide hours of entertainment. But be warned: it’s not easy. I have some of the clues figured out but have yet to complete the game successfully.
On the Propulsion Games website, the devs say they are focused on harnessing the power of cooperative play, whether through a PC or a PDF or puzzles on paper. I think a cooperative mode would be an excellent option for this game, and I think that will be my next move.
I want to put the spirits to rest, but I think I need to harness the power of multiple brains! I’ll just have to wrangle some friends into getting this game and studying the case notes. If you want to join the ghost hunt, let me know if you can solve the mysteries!
THE VERDICT
Twisted Logic: Abbotsfield is a beautifully scary game with solid storytelling and a truly challenging objective.
Twisted Logic: Abbotsfield is available via Steam.

ZPELLCATZ REVIEW – KITTEN QUESTS AND FELINE FIREBALLS,https://indiegamereviewer.com/zpellcatz-review-kitten-quests-and-feline-fireballs/,"ZPELLCATZ BY SIMAGAMES
ZpellCatZ is an action RPG set in a world of cats.
Solo developer Florian Siemer, a.k.a. SimaGames, isn’t the first to come up with such an idea, of course, but his execution of the concept is different from what you’d probably expect and interesting enough to make up for the game’s other minor flaws.
FELINE FANTASY
Most obviously, ZpellCatZ takes its premise seriously, and apart from the obvious, it’s a surprisingly straightforward fantasy plot in almost all aspects.
ZpellCatZ begins with our hero – a traveler and aspiring magic-wielder – nearly dying in a shipwreck while searching for a mystical island. Nursed back to health by one of the island’s inhabitants, you’re enlisted in the locals’ struggle against an evil cult.
The whole feline thing is barely acknowledged, and when it is – the Isle of Mana is home to a breed of cats with great magical skill that also happen to be green – it’s played totally straight, unlike such games as the Cat Quest series.
There are probably more cat jokes in my review of ZpellCatZ than the entirety of the game itself.
A SONG OF MICE AND FIRE
The other twist on ZpellCatZ is that all combat is entirely magic-driven. From your whiskered wizard player character to the frogs, ducks, and other dungeon-dwellers you’ll be dueling, everybody’s got a staff or two.
Siemer put some real thought into the magical system, and it’s deep enough to let you create your preferred play style. You’ve got several character classes to start with, then you can augment your attacks with everything from area-of-effect fireballs to totems that blast enemies automatically.
There are also plenty of passive skills to upgrade, different familiars/pets to enlist, and lots of cosmetic options for your low-poly feline wand-wielder (I stuck a pointy wizard hat on mine).
MEOWGIC: THE GATHERING
While ZpellCatZ takes itself seriously as an RPG, it does fall prey to some of the genre’s pitfalls.
It’s a little bloated with fetch quests; collect his many carrots, that many frog skulls, not to mention all of the plot-central Mana Essences.
The dungeons can also get predictable after a while. They’re procedurally generated, but there are few enough source elements that after working your way through a few of them, you’ll run out of surprises pretty quickly.
THE VERDICT
ZpellCatZ is a solid effort from a solo dev, and the juxtaposition of the “save the world, young wizard” fantasy RPG plot stuff and a world of cats – green magical cats, no less – is an unexpected if confusing delight that makes up for a somewhat repetitive game loop.
ZpellCatZ is available via Steam.
