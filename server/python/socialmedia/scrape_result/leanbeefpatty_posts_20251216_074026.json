I still work my abs ofc, and like they say “built in the gym, revealed in the kitchen” but since I havent had access to my favorite ab machine (weighted crunch) I have been admittedly slacking. No passion 💃 like I had for yearsssss hitting abs. This is what they mean when they say discipline. It’s time to do the thing even when it’s not fun anymore. \n\nFit @gymshark @gymsharkwomen dc BEEF \nFueled by @gorillamind @gorillamindenergy dc BEEF \n\nV/tuck up (if you can’t do v bc it’s pretty intense, just do tuck, hand assist as needed). The v & tuck count as 1\n\nLeg lift. For best resistance you only raise 6-12inches. Above that reduces tension but can offer a nice momentary rest while still moving. Hands under rump for assist.\n\n3way mountain climber. Straight, cross, out (this counts as 1).\n\nClassic crunch. I hold the back of my head for support. DONT yank your head/neck. \n.\n.\n.\n.\n#abworkouts #athomeworkout #homeabs #homeworkoutvideos #abs #leanmuscles #musclebuilding #gymworkout #gymtips #workoutroutines\"",
