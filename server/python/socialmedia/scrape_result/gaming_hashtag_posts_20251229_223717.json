I definitely have a soft spot for animals. It was fun to see how the buildings and critters paired together. \n\nSince I only played once, it's difficult to comment on the overall strategy, but it did  seem like there were variable approaches to success, which is nice. I had a good time playing Everdell, however, I prefer games that have more player interaction involved. There was the opportunity to block key spaces and ride that out as long as possible, and potentially take cards that may have been valuable to your opponents, but other than that, I didn't feel like there was much I could do to affect my neighbours. Is there a solo mode in Everdell? I feel like this is the type of game I would prefer in a solo environment. Just myself, a mission and a pretty theme. \n\nHave you played Everdell? What are your thoughts? \n\n#everdell #nature #meeples #animals #critters #fantasy #forest #meadow #pretty #boardgames #gamer #tabletopgames #games #gaming #brettspiel #juegosdemesa #tree #jeuxdesociete #nerd #geek  #photooftheday #coins #gamenight #cardgame #resources #play\"",
