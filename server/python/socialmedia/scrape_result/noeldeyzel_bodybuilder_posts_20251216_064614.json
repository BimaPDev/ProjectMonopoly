He recounts how he and his mother struggled with poverty, but he refused to be defined by his circumstances. Instead, he channeled his pain into fuel to create a better life for himself and his future family. This powerful message is a reminder that we all have the power to break the cycle of suffering and create a brighter future. By sharing his story, the father hopes to inspire others to do the same and become the best version of themselves.",
